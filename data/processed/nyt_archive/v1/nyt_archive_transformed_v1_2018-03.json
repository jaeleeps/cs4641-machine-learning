It will again feature casual indoor and outdoor dining on the lawn and covered patio, with a somewhat more formal menu in the dining room inside. Lobster tempura, tomato salad and rib-eye for two are likely to be served. Large-format dinners for groups of six to eight will again be available. Unlike last season\u2019s pop-up, which was a way to keep staff employed while Eleven Madison Park underwent renovations, this one will hire mainly from the community. The success of the experiment led Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara\u2019s Make It Nice group to plan a similar winter branch, to open in December, in Aspen, Colo. Both will be run in partnership with American Express, the only credit card accepted at the pop-ups. Starting May 1, reservations for the indoor dining room can be made online through June 30; as of June 1, they can be made through July 31, and starting July 1, they will be taken through September: 341 Pantigo Road, East Hampton, N.Y., empsummerhouse.com.",

One route to actually winning those titles seemed clear: N.B.A. championships are won by teams with a superstar, and preferably two or three. The most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft. And the draft\u2019s rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records.

This would take a while to bring positive results, but Hinkie implored fans to ignore the team\u2019s losses and look at the big picture. \u201cWe talk a lot about process,\u201d he said, \u201cnot outcome.\u201d",

During its reign, his namesake shop-cum-gallery in SoHo, which opened in 1994 and closed in 2012, defined avant-garde good taste. Moss blurred the lines between art and design and reinvented visual merchandising, displaying everything from an 18th-century Nymphenburg figurine to a kaleidoscopic array of Maarten Baas Clay chairs inside massive vitrines within the immaculate white space. After almost 50 years in Manhattan, the 68-year-old, who now runs his own design and retail consulting firm, moved to a traditional clapboard house in Connecticut last year with his partner in life and business, Franklin Getchell, with whom he has also co-authored a new Rizzoli book, out this April, documenting the cultural influence of the Moss store. But to this day, Moss still considers his childhood growing up in the suburbs of \u201960s Chicago to be his most formative period. When his father insisted on installing electric hand-dryers and Borax soap dispensers in the bathrooms of their home, his mother agreed, provided their decorator could enamel them in pink and turquoise pastels. \u201cTo me, that epitomized what Modernism should be,\u201d Moss says. \u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated by the juxtaposition of the industrial and the decorative ever since.\u201d",

About a year and a half ago, he said, the operators of the Holiday Inn in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, came to him about opening a restaurant in the hotel. He pitched the name, Brasserie Seoul, and some ideas for a menu of French fare with Korean touches that expanded on what he was serving at his Bistro Petit in Williamsburg. But that\u2019s as far as it went; he never cooked at Brasserie Seoul. And despite the name he suggested, the restaurant served what he called \u201cordinary K-Town food\u201d like the bibimbap found all over West 32nd Street. Now, a new group runs the hotel, and he was approached again. \u201cThey asked if I believed in fate,\u201d said the veteran chef, who is 47. \u201cAnd they gave me a chance to do my brainchild, my dream.\u201d His menu features French techniques with Korean ingredients, reflecting his background and his years in the kitchens of chefs like Wayne Nish, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Laurent Tourondel. His kimchi bouillabaisse is based on a South Korean fish stew, and his Korean beef bourguignon is similar to the long, slow French braise. Cod comes crusted with fermented black beans, and several dishes are fueled with his homemade kimchi. The spacious dining room is centered on the bar and has a profusion of greenery.

There may be variations down the road. These will be served to eat-in, on velvety gray lounge chairs and at a handsome bar, or to take away during the day. In the evening, the whole place, including the lounge upstairs, will serve cocktails and small plates of cold items like hamachi crudo and tuna tartare, along with the mochi and pastries.

In the \u201970s, Gordon, now 68, graduated from college to a life in letters, and she memorized lines from \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday,\u201d a 1971 film directed by John Schlesinger and starring Jackson as Alex, a woman competing with a doctor, played by Peter Finch, for the love of a young male sculptor and coming to terms with free love. As Gordon\u2019s novels and nonfiction \u2014 including an important 1978 essay on abortion rights published in the New York Review of Books \u2014 won her increasing acclaim, she watched Jackson, now a two-time Oscar winner, make a turn to a surprising second career as a liberal member of Parliament beginning in 1992. Finally, and just as surprisingly, Jackson returned to acting. Just after turning 80 two years ago, she won raves in London as a gender-blind King Lear. This spring brings Jackson back to Broadway, starring in the revival of Edward Albee\u2019s 1991 play \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d which opens March 29, about a woman recalling her life\u2019s great triumphs and regrets.

In doing so, it protected a range of domestic programs the president had targeted for huge reductions, if not outright elimination, and sent an infuriated Mr. Trump scuttling off to Mar-a-Lago with yet another problem to worry about: a mediocre Congress making a lazy president look even worse by actually accomplishing something.",

Coco Pazzo, which opened in 1988 and was forced to close 10 years ago, proved that his Tuscan approach could work with white tablecloths on the Upper East Side. Now with his business partner, Alessandro Bandini, he is opening another Coco Pazzo, in SoHo, in a brightly windowed contemporary take on that Tuscan farmhouse. And he is serving some pasta entrees that he calls piatti unici; they include linguine with clam rag\u00f9, with clams oreganata alongside; and pappardelle with stracotto braised brisket, the pot roast sharing the plate with pasta dressed in its sauce. Mr. Luongo\u2019s longtime collaborator, the chef Marta Pulini, is a consultant. By day, the restaurant is Coco Pazzo Kitchen, mainly for salads, sandwiches and pasta. In the evening, it becomes Coco Pazzo Trattoria, offering soups, salads, seafood antipasti, his piatti unici, and main courses meant for sharing like whole roast chicken or a 24-ounce grilled rib-eye. In the rear of the restaurant is a small shop selling food to take out: 160 Prince Street (Thompson Street), 917-261-6321, cocopazzonyc.com. ",

Lately, though, Uptown\u2019s new cultural centers and restaurants have fueled a creative spirit in this highly-diverse neighborhood. While debates over affordable housing and development remain huge issues in the area, Uptown is ready again for its close-up.",
