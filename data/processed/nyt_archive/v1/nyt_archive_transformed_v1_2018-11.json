Maiolino, 76, is an Italian, S\\u00e3o Paulo-based artist celebrated for her modeled- and rolled-clay installations and sculptures that suggest the work of \\u201ca housewife gone mad,\\u201d as the curator Helen Molesworth once put it, and evoke everything from human organs, phalluses and rolls of bread to prehistoric worms. Barlow had a traditional arts education at London\\u2019s Chelsea College of Arts, followed by the Slade. Maiolino had a very nontraditional upbringing and education, migrating with her family from Italy to Venezuela during World War II, and then from Venezuela to Brazil, where her performances, videos and works on paper contributed, alongside work by Lygia Clark and H\\u00e9lio Oiticica, to the Neo-Concrete and New Objectivity movements at a time of political upheaval in Brazil. (She audited classes at an art school in Rio de Janeiro but considers herself largely self-taught.) Both artists are mothers, and both received full recognition for their pioneering work late in life \\u2014 and continue to make work in their 70s as a matter of some urgency. This month, their artworks are on view in concurrent solo exhibitions at Hauser & Wirth in New York, where we met on a brisk fall morning.

For one, they\\u2019re both artists whose gay identity is neither incidental to their work nor all-consuming. For another, they are both tireless artistic explorers, catholic in the extreme. Wainwright, son of the \\u201970s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 \\u201cWant\\u201d albums. Then he decided to write operas \\u2014 the second, \\u201cHadrian,\\u201d with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October \\u2014 and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilson\\u2019s 2009 staging of Shakespeare\\u2019s sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose \\u201cThe Crucible\\u201d and \\u201cA View From the Bridge\\u201d he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered \\u201cA Little Life,\\u201d adapted from the novel written by T\\u2019s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumet\\u2019s prescient 1976 media satire, \\u201cNetwork\\u201d (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, \\u201cSword of Damocles,\\u201d as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self \\u2014 and the benefits of boarding school. \",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Rufus Wainwright and Ivo van Hove Talk Politics, Coming Out and Boarding School\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2018-11-20T14:30:00+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"Black Friday and Cyber Monday may be known for hot gadgets and electronics, but there are great deals on other things, too.

One of the great paradoxes of America is that we could be a country that elected its first black president, one whose term saw, yes, a radically more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but also one of the worst school shootings in our history, a mass shooting at a gay nightclub and multiple murders of unarmed black boys and men, shot because of who they were, not what they did. Crucially, that president\\u2019s reactions to these horrors were markedly different than those of our current president to similar incidents, but the fact remains that no era since our founding has been free of these contradictions (indeed, these murders that occurred during the previous administration were not new developments \\u2014 it was technology that enabled their immediate and widespread dissemination). The thrill and sorrow of America is that our brief history is one of steps forward and backward, that ours is a nation in a constant state of revision, that we are each of us choreographers of its halting, tripping, sometimes ugly, sometimes transcendent dance.\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"T\\u2019s Holiday Issue: All Together Now\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2018-11-30T10:13:46+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"He Jiankui\\u2019s claim to have edited babies\\u2019 genes has caused soul-searching in China, where many believe scientists need more ethical supervision.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"He Jiankui\\u2019s claim to have edited babies\\u2019 genes has caused soul-searching in China, where many believe scientists need more ethical supervision.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"BEIJING \\u2014 First it was a proposal to transplant a head to a new body.
