All the money goes to the National Restaurant Association\u2019s Restaurant Employee Relief Fund.

Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Fam\u00edlia Geisse\u2019s Cave Amadeu R\u00fastico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it\u2019s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery\u2019s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It\u2019s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what\u2019s called a p\u00e9t-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",

On the night we meet him, after the drinks have stopped flowing and the band has gone home, the jazz pianist at the center of this multilingual mini-series, Elliot Udo (Andr\u00e9 Holland), settles at a piano onstage at the Paris club he co-owns. He presses his fingers to the keys. At the bottom of the screen, a bracketed caption flashes. \u201cSad chord,\u201d it reads. \u201cPlaintive melody.\u201d In other words: All is not well. The club is struggling. Its patrons are asking why Elliot doesn\u2019t perform anymore. Elliot\u2019s business partner, Farid (Tahar Rahim), is apparently involved in illicit activity. And soon, Elliot\u2019s teenage daughter, Julie (Amandla Stenberg), will arrive from the United States to live with him. So begins the story of \u201cThe Eddy,\u201d a jazz-forward mini-series written by Jack Thorne and directed by filmmakers who, perhaps unsurprisingly, include Damien Chazelle (\u201cLa La Land,\u201d \u201cWhiplash\u201d).

But with artworks arriving and her guests expected, she shrugged at the massing clouds, determined the evening should go on. The furniture was taken inside and then reassembled an hour later once the shower had passed. Looking back now, from a radically altered world of shelter-in-place orders and social distancing, guests fondly recall the evening as one of the last when they were able to mingle freely with friends old and new. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to remember that dinner now,\u201d said Schurer Merckoll late last month. \u201cIt feels so special because it gives me hope for more positive times to come.\u201d",

This documentary takes viewers inside Biosphere 2 (known as No. 2 because Biosphere 1 is the Earth), an experimental research facility that was built by a Texas oil tycoon to prove that humans could remain healthy while quarantining in a bubble. Built in Oracle, Ariz., with its own mini-rainforest, desert and ocean with a living coral reef, the idyllic bubble was meant to prepare scientists for space colonization. But in 1991, when the first eight scientists sealed themselves inside the terrarium-like habitat for the two-year experiment, things went awry. Directed by Matt Wolf (\u201cTeenage\u201d), this film looks at the odd and dark twists that took place in the utopian biosphere.",

This limited series, based on Wally Lamb\u2019s 1998 novel, stars Mark Ruffalo as the twins Dominick and Thomas Birdsey. Written and directed by Derek Cianfrance (\u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines\u201d), the six-episode series follows Dominick as he tries to care for his brother, who has schizophrenia, and who cuts off his right hand in the opening scene of the book. To embody two distinctly different identical twins, Ruffalo told The New York Times that he gained 30 pounds during a six-week filming break before shooting his scenes as Thomas. As the twins deal with familial trauma and mental illness, they grapple with the messy nature of care and conflict.",

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission \u2014 the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.",

One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on \u201cHamlet.\u201d As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an \u201cinteresting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one,\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is \u201cOphelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king\u2019s castle \u2014 and being excluded from studying with the boys \u2014 grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.\u201d",

Zenovich doesn\u2019t shy away from tough questions, and by interviewing Armstrong\u2019s family, friends, rivals and others, she manages to create an objective portrait of a shunned star.

Decades later, as social media has catapulted academic jargon into everyday vocabulary, the term has become warped to signify a restructuring of society, with minorities at the top. But still this theory \u2014 that identity categories are not mutually exclusive, but integrated components of a single, multidimensional experience \u2014 remains immensely relevant today.

Maybe Hou was simply too challenging, too singular and too uncommercial for any distributor here to touch, cinephiles scoffed. The longtime advocate J. Hoberman chalked it up less to difficulty than to regional bias: He speculated that if Hou were French, his films would draw crowds.",

Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: \u201cPourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon?\u201d (Why so much grief over a pencil?) That question has remained with Davey, the New York-based artist, for 50 years. The anecdote \u2014 the triviality of the pencil, the pinprick of a particular line \u2014 is emblematic of her art, in which tension comes from small traumas and everyday talismans. Moving between video, photography and prose, Davey\u2019s work is bound by idiosyncratic references and quasi-dreamed connections. An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the \u201ctiny spark of accident\u201d that will set off stray thoughts and images. \u201cIndex Cards,\u201d which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Davey\u2019s methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation.",
