In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it\\u2019s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery\\u2019s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It\\u2019s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what\\u2019s called a p\\u00e9t-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate.

In his 2018 historical drama, \\u201cJeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc,\\u201d the French director Bruno Dumont infused Saint Joan\\u2019s formative years with a sonic landscape that featured prominent, raucous guitar shredding. For his follow-up, \\u201cJoan of Arc,\\u201d Dumont focuses on Joan of Arc\\u2019s later years, this time using electronic pop music to help tell the story. The film casts one of the performers who played Joan in Dumont\\u2019s earlier movie, Lise Leplat Prudhomme, opposite the French pop singer Christophe, who plays one of the priests who try Joan. \\u201cHere and in the earlier picture it\\u2019s perhaps easy to apprehend Dumont\\u2019s approach with a \\u2018What\\u2019s this oddball up to now?\\u2019 smirk,\\u201d Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. \\u201cBut if Dumont is joking at all, it\\u2019s a form of what used to be called \\u2018kidding on the square.\\u2019\\u201d\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"What\\u2019s on TV Thursday: \\u2018Joan of Arc\\u2019 and \\u2018Princess Mononoke\\u2019\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-05-28T05:00:10+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"The transaction represented a symbolic closing to G.E.\\u2019s opening chapters in the second Industrial Revolution.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"The transaction represented a symbolic closing to G.E.\\u2019s opening chapters in the second Industrial Revolution.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"More than 140 years after Thomas Edison and his assistants conducted their first successful experiments with a carbon-filament lamp in a vacuum, the company he helped to found \\u2014 General Electric \\u2014 has sold its lighting business.\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"G.E., Which Traces Its Roots to Thomas Edison, Sells Its Lighting Business\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-05-28T05:00:34+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"The move is almost certain to face a court challenge and signals the latest salvo by President Trump to crack down on online platforms.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"The move is almost certain to face a court challenge and signals the latest salvo by President Trump to crack down on online platforms.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"The Trump administration is preparing an executive order intended to curtail the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for what gets posted on their platforms, two senior administration officials said early Thursday.\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Trump Prepares Order to Limit Social Media Companies\\u2019 Protections\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-05-28T05:52:33+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"This word has appeared in three articles on NYTimes.com in the past year.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"This word has appeared in three articles on NYTimes.com in the past year.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"_________\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Word + Quiz: vagary\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-05-28T06:00:02+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"What restaurants have you missed the most during quarantine?
