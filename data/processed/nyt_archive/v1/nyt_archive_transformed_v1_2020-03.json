The portrait is a gift for H\\u00e9lo\\u00efse\\u2019s future husband, but she is dreading the wedding and refuses to sit for the painting. So her mother hires Marianne as a companion and asks her to create the artwork in secret after observing H\\u00e9lo\\u00efse\\u2019s every move. Her looks don\\u2019t go unnoticed. The more time H\\u00e9lo\\u00efse and Marianne spend alone, the deeper they fall into a passionate affair.
