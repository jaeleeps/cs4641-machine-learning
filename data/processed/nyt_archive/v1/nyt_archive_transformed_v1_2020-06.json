One such resource that has resurfaced is this documentary, which is streaming for free through June 12. In the 1960s, Swedish journalists came to the United States to explore the nascent black power movement. They interviewed political activists including Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale, as well as residents of Harlem, Brooklyn and Oakland. About 30 years later, their footage was discovered by a Swedish television network, and the director Goran Hugo Olsson pieced clips together to create this film. He also added voice-over commentary by contemporary figures, like Erykah Badu and Questlove, who explain the movement\u2019s relevance decades later.

In ancient Egypt, it was used to ward off evil forces. Buddhist monks, too, relied (and still rely) on incense to purify their meditation spaces, while in Japan, the Koh-Do (incense ceremony) has been popular since courtiers and samurai took it up in the 16th century. Of course, incense also just smells nice, its scent hanging in the room even after the physical material has burned to a tidy pile of ash. But protection and cleanliness feel like particularly appealing aims right now, as does the idea of creating a ritual, and thus imposing a modicum of regularity and intention amid so much uncertainty.",

ABC is resurfacing it \u2014 with a new introduction by John Legend \u2014 as police brutality and institutional racism consume the nation following the death of George Floyd.

A prosecutor in their case was a young Roy Cohn, whose involvement quickly led Senator Joseph McCarthy \u2014 a staunch anti-communist Republican \u2014 to appoint Cohn to his chief counsel. There, Cohn played a major role in expelling government officials thought to be communists or gay, and shortly thereafter he became a personal lawyer to then-businessman Donald J. Trump. Though Cohn played many prominent roles, much of his personal life was veiled from public view. He was thought to be gay, despite his opposition to homosexuality, and he died from AIDS in 1986.

After 17 years of trying, Marky\u2019s, a caviar producer, importer and dealer in Florida, has a crop of beluga from its Sturgeon Aquafarms in northern Florida. The importation, distribution and sale of purebred huso huso, or beluga, in the United States have been banned by the Fish & Wildlife Service since 2005, but this Marky\u2019s caviar has been granted an exception to the ruling. So now, if you have $420 to splurge on a half-ounce, you can indulge in the delicate, buttery, nicely textured, though modest-grained, charcoal gray roe. And if a holiday in summer might not whet the appetite for jewel-box caviar, Marky\u2019s also offers a celebratory package of American roes containing two ounces each of hackleback, paddlefish and salmon roes with blini and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for $115 to enjoy on the Fourth.",
