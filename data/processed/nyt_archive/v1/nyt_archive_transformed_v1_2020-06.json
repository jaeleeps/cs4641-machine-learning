Now, as we giggle at the photos, I ask follow-up questions and feel grateful to be home with her. \\u2014 Tenzin Wangmo\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Tiny Love Stories: \\u2018My Mother Has Been a Nanny for Six Families\\u2019\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-06-09T19:06:31+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"As Sana\\u00eb Lemoine\\u2019s debut novel progresses, its narrator falls increasingly in thrall to the only people who seem interested in her inner life.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"As Sana\\u00eb Lemoine\\u2019s debut novel progresses, its narrator falls increasingly in thrall to the only people who seem interested in her inner life.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"One of the worst things about being 17 is the gulf between how much you feel and how little you know.
