In the years since, and especially in the last decade, the art world has transformed into a global monolith: there are now galleries with hundreds of employees and branches across several continents, businesses that have grown into international corporations overseeing the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year (and in some cases more). The industry is now an interconnected network of money and power that includes auction houses, where sales records are broken in a practiced routine that it is both mundane and exhausting, and art fairs, a pure distillation of capitalism in which galleries of all sizes pay large sums of money \u2014 thousands for a smaller gallery, usually tens of thousands for a larger one \u2014 to operate booths and peddle their wares to collectors (there are now more than 100 big ones all over the world). Art dealers are the entryway into this system, and many of those who began with mere ambitions to discover and financially support artists now must contend with the omnipresent threat of larger galleries, which scoop up those artists once they\u2019ve become commercially successful.",

The dinner menu will also feature mafrum, a dish built around stuffed, flattened potatoes. The restaurant will seat about 30, with some outdoor tables as well.

In February, as three members of the New York band led by the 22-year-old saxophonist Isaiah Barr prepared to perform at the Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, the audience filled with young people dressed in high-end streetwear, and the downtown jazz mainstays Marc Ribot and Roy Nathanson joined onstage on guitar and alto sax. Before long, Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Barr\u2019s horns were chasing each other down winding paths. The drummer Jamire Williams alternated between being a perfect metronome to playing offbeat so vigorously he nearly fell off his stool. At the end of the night, the audience rose to its feet slowly, staggered by the sound echoing through the Synagogue\u2019s halls.",

The author, Eug\u00e8ne Briffault, was a journalist, gastronome, editor and critic who frequented the upper echelons of French society in the mid-19th century, a time of prosperity, indulgence and refinement. His book starts with dining habits in earlier eras and goes on to provide often acerbic commentary on the scene of his time, when Paris was considered to be the center of the culinary world. The book is filled with observations that still apply, like how the newly affluent display money but no taste, how female cooks are undervalued, how off-season vegetables please the eye but not the palate, and how tourism can be credited for the city\u2019s cosmopolitan outlook. He suggests that \u201cto be happy with the waiter, make sure the waiter is happy with you,\u201d and notes that Parisians tossed their salads with about 500,000 gallons of vinegar a year. He covers the rich, the poor and even hospital food.",
