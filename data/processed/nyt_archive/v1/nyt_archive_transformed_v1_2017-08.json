But she hadn\u2019t made much progress when she fell ill, and was still working out details of the plot with occasional help from her friend and fellow novelist Joan Hess. So her estate, naturally enough, asked Hess if she would finish the book that Mertz had started. \u201cMy first response was an adamant refusal,\u201d Hess writes in a preface to \u201cThe Painted Queen,\u201d new at No. 7 on the hardcover fiction list. \u201cThe idea of attempting to capture her voice, her erudite style, her wit and her vast knowledge of archaeology in the early 20th century seemed ludicrous.

Where there were no tires, jagged sheets of metal or rusting barrels had been propped up to create a makeshift shield. The edges of the flat roof were lined with barrels and sandbags. The 500-bed facility, the biggest oncology hospital in Syria, stands on the edge of an old highway, near the Al-Assad and Harasta suburbs, overlooking an active front line between government and opposition forces. As the engines of passing warplanes sucked at the air overhead, soldiers patrolled the grounds. For the government, the highway is a direct supply line to the police hospital and barracks beside the cancer center. For the opposition, controlling the road would provide them a chance to break a siege that has left most medical facilities destroyed or empty.",

This 4,800-square-foot Brooklyn restaurant is the first of several projects for which Ms. Brefere is the culinary director.

The company\u2019s executive chef, Rostislav Kemelman, who worked at restaurants owned by Bobby Flay, April Bloomfield and Shelly Fireman, relies on local purveyors whenever possible, and the restaurant proudly lists more than a dozen. The menu includes dishes like bouillabaisse, pot-au-feu, salmon choucroute and French onion soup. Lighter fare, like a croque-monsieur and various tartines, will also be served. In the fall, there will be a bigger KarV\u00e9r (pronounced kar-VAIR) opening in Chelsea, and another in Downtown Brooklyn. Ms. Brefere said the location for the company\u2019s first restaurant was chosen because many of the investors were Russian-Americans with roots in the neighborhood. \u201cIt also makes for a good testing ground for the launch before we go into Manhattan,\u201d she said.

The family embraced Tim, but the adjustment has been rocky, especially among some of the men. Tim has earned back this trust by being both husband and physical caretaker of our ailing relative. One recent evening, while his husband was ill, Tim and I sat alone in their home. The conversation turned to gun politics; I\u2019m a closeted gun rights sympathizer. Perhaps sensing some undue camaraderie, Tim stole away to the foyer, then returned with an unloaded black shotgun and ammunition. Tim told me not to mention this to our family \u2014 or to my relative, who doesn\u2019t know about the shotgun even though they live together. We also have children in the family, who visit Tim and his husband with frequency, and I\u2019m well aware of the statistics about households that keep guns. I plan to advise Tim at least to move the gun elsewhere, out of the house. However, that does not seem to be enough. Having the gun in the house suggests a lack of judgment; it seems like a serious breach of trust and, God forbid, potentially dangerous. Doesn\u2019t this directly contravene Tim\u2019s claim to being a responsible caretaker, an ethical impetus that overrides confidentiality? Another twist: I also know that if the gun (or ammunition) were discovered, it could be just the excuse our extremely anti-gun family needs to disavow Tim. This seems like a bitter pileup of issues \u2014 gay equality, gun safety and family loyalty. Name Withheld",

While living near Toulouse in the \u201990s, Uniacke began collecting pieces from flea markets across France. A decade later, she opened a shop on the design-boutique-rich Pimlico Road, which has become a pilgrimage site for local and visiting aesthetes. Sparingly appointed with Regency chairs and Art Nouveau sconces \u2014 as well as simpler pieces, including a giant copper planter designed by Uniacke and stocked with firewood \u2014 it also carries her own line of furniture and her newly launched fabric collection, which, as one might expect, is exactly what you need for modern country life: supple linens from the U.K. and mohair velvets in earth and jewel tones \u2014 and nothing more.",

(It worked for Brown. His Dante-influenced thriller spent more than a year on the hardcover and paperback fiction lists.) Even so, the Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has raised eyebrows by calling his new anti-Trump manifesto \u201cConscience of a Conservative.\u201d That\u2019s because Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1960 book of that title, which stayed on the Times nonfiction list for 31 weeks, is still revered as a founding document of the modern conservative movement. Right-wing commentators who aren\u2019t as ready to abandon the president see Flake\u2019s appropriation of the name more as apostasy than as the homage Flake intended, and object to the book\u2019s attacks on the Republican establishment.

			"lead_paragraph": "The skies over Broadway will be darker come Sunday, Sept. 3, when one of the brightest shows to blaze there in many seasons, Dave Malloy\u2019s \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,\u201d ends its exuberant run. This musical reimagining of a section of Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d directed with boundless inventiveness by Rachel Chavkin, began life in a small Off Broadway space under the auspices of Ars Nova five years ago. Its admirers were surprised and delighted when it transferred to the big time last November \u2014 at the Imperial Theater \u2014 without shedding a spark of its extravagant individuality, and it picked up 12 Tony nominations, the most of any show that season. The reasons for its premature demise are complicated and unpleasant. Instead of revisiting them, make a point of seeing \u2014 or-re-seeing \u2014 a one-of-a-kind triumph of the imagination. For the show\u2019s last days, Mr. Malloy himself will be playing that great klutz of a hero, Pierre. (249 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200; greatcometbroadway.com.)",

As an adventure photographer, he has since accompanied the climber Ed Viesturs and the filmmaker David Breashears to the top of Mount Everest, trekked unsupported across 300 miles of the Chang Tang Plateau in Tibet and was a member of the first American team to ski down from the top of Everest. His work has been published in National Geographic and The New York Times Magazine, and his film \u201cMeru,\u201d documenting his pioneering ascent up Meru Peak in the Himalayas with two other climbers, won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015. He counts landscape paintings from the Song dynasty in China and Chinese calligraphy, which he says is \u201cabout balance and use of space,\u201d among his artistic influences in capturing vast landscapes, often with a person in them for context.

But if Schultz had doubts about some of his party\u2019s priorities, he welcomed its ascendance to power.

In the 1800s, its surrounding bluestone rock was used to create many of N.Y.C.\u2019s sidewalks, and its farms and dairies now supply many of the city\u2019s best restaurants with organic vegetables and cheeses. Unlike more densely settled, gentrified areas outside the city, such as the Hudson River Valley or the Hamptons, this corner of the state feels lost in time, a cluster of tiny two-block hamlets that follow the twists of the Delaware River. Famous for its fly-fishing, it was once home to a number of 19th-century outdoors clubs (some of which still exist today) on the Beaverkill, a trout-stocked tributary of the Delaware. Later, an absence of trains linking Sullivan County to Manhattan, along with a lack of sophisticated hotels and restaurants, preserved the area\u2019s untrammeled remoteness, leaving it largely underdeveloped and undervisited.",

A chicken-fried steak is nothing to champion, after all, at least on its face. It\u2019s just cheap beef pounded thin, dressed in seasoned flour and fried, an Americanized taste of the schnitzel brought to Texas by German immigrants in the 19th century. Peppery cream gravy generally accompanies the steak. That gravy can be gummy when it\u2019s not prepared well. And the steak beneath it can be dry, or soggy, or both. Ours was neither. Walsh and I marveled at the way the texture of the meat\u2019s crisp exterior was heightened by the silkiness of the gravy, at the way sweet and salty combined in the dish and at the manner in which the whole experience was so much greater than the parts. Soon enough I went home to recreate the meal.",
