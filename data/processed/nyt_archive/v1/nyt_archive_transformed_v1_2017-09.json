The most obvious questions are: Who will be the next director, and when will he \u2014 or, better yet, she \u2014 be appointed?",

There\u2019s a 16-seat dessert bar, as well as booths and tables, and playing-card motifs on the walls. The six-course dessert tasting, which includes some more savory items, like olive oil gelato with sea salt and eucalyptus to clear the palate, is $68, by reservation for people of drinking age.

Good-naturedly dodging his mother\u2019s entreaties to settle down, the peripatetic and engaging Kasliwal scours the world for outrageous gems (a recent find was an old 10-carat mine diamond at a Las Vegas antiques show) and the best parties.

There were alternative lists of 150 additional albums not on the NPR list. Quibbling with the particulars of the list is one thing. It did overlook a lot. But the quibbling misses an important concern about what it means to argue for a female-only canon. The power of the list came, in part, from its mere existence, from how necessary it felt. Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters. This week we talk about why it does. We also talk about the very different ways we experienced the list, and we revisit the song of the summer, a phenomenon that, once again, was ruled by male artists.",

It wasn\u2019t from the nonstop news coverage on CNN and elsewhere; it was from the transmissions that lay behind it, in the pulses of information coming down from space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, crucial tools for monitoring big storms in the Gulf of Mexico, were capturing cloud formations, surface temperatures and barometric pressures, which were then fed into computer models tracking the storm\u2019s strength and intensity. At the same time, NASA was using a group of satellites to keep tabs on soil moisture, flood patterns and power failures all over East Texas. In various ways, this torrent of data was being collected continuously from hundreds (or even thousands) of miles overhead, through radar instruments and spectroradiometer sensors and exquisitely calibrated imaging cameras. The machines being used aren\u2019t household names \u2014 they go by acronyms like GOES-13, Modis and SMAP \u2014 but they demonstrate why the popular view of Earth as a big blue planet with only the Moon as its companion could do with some revising.

Belgium\u2019s architectural conservation laws had been notoriously lax, and so over the decades many of those buildings were demolished or carved up into offices or apartments.

Alice Waters? The owner of Chez Panisse and generalissimo of the organic food revolution? Back then, she happily admits, her favorite lunch was grilled cheese with pickles and maybe an orange soda, if she could sneak out to a local dinette. \u201cI think of grilled cheese sandwiches as one of the great comfort foods,\u201d she writes, before snapping out of it to become the Waters we all recognize: \u201cThese days I make them with a Cantal, a mountain cheese from France that\u2019s a little like a Swiss \u2014 I like my cheese to be a bit tangy. I usually choose some good whole wheat or levain bread from Acme Bread Company. I slice the cheese and put it inside the bread, put some olive oil in a cast iron pan \u2014 not too much! \u2014 drizzle oil on the top of the sandwich, and then weight it down with another cast iron pan. When it gets really brown, I turn it over, and when the cheese starts to bubble out the sides, I take it out. Then I rub both sides with half a clove of garlic and serve it with a dill pickle or some sauerkraut (good homemade sauerkraut, not the kraut out of the can that I never liked as a child!). Or I\u2019ll have a little undressed salad on the side \u2014 the melted cheese and the olive oil from the sandwich almost dress the lettuce. Sometimes in the summer I\u2019ll put some hot peppers in.\u201d All right, that does sound pretty good. But it\u2019s probably for the best that Chez Panisse never established a children\u2019s menu. I\u2019d hate to see what Waters does to chicken fingers.",

Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos have taken the opposite approach, filling a pop-up shop in a South Kensington, London townhouse with design pieces by people they already love and collect: their friends. It\u2019s an impressive group that includes Martino Gamper, famous for his 3D drawing project \u201c100 Chairs in 100 Days,\u201d whose button-top stools figure in the space, and his wife, the sculptor Francis Upritchard, who helped choose a vibrant orange for the walls. The shade reminded Pilotto and de Vos of houses they\u2019d seen on a recent trip to Lima, Peru (\u201cwe\u2019re currently in a South America phase,\u201d Pilotto says). Elsewhere is a hand-knotted rug with a painterly diamond motif from Ecuador, an actual painting by Peter McDonald and a bench that the designer Bethan Laura Wood covered with a rainbow-hued patchwork textile. It\u2019s a perfect complement to the brand\u2019s latest ready-to-wear collection, which Pilotto describes as \u201ctropical-baroque\u201d and includes quilted microfiber jackets and an asymmetrical dress embroidered with chenille yarn. One day, he and de Vos were in the studio of the glassblower Jochen Holz and found themselves drawn to a series of glass coat hooks Holz had made, which Holz has now remade for them as a series of sculptural glass-drop earrings and cuffs. \u201cIt was about playing with different materials and seeing what we could do,\u201d says Pilotto. \u201cAnd just such a natural dialogue between disciplines.\u201d Fittingly, the shop will stay open through fashion week, the London Design Festival and Frieze. 3 Cromwell Pl., London \u2014 KATE GUADAGNINO ",

Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men\u2019s work. Not anymore.Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women\u2019s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedro\u2019s largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.Three years later, Ms. Choumali\u2019s project, \u201cSissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),\u201d illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa\u2019s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers.

It begins not with a spark of passion but with a sensible, if unusual, proposal. Addie Moore shows up at Louis Waters\u2019s house and asks if he will sleep with her. Addie doesn\u2019t mean she wants to have sex with Louis. She wants to slide under the covers next to him, turn off the bedside lamp and chat quietly until slumber arrives, simulating the easy marital intimacy that the two of them, both long widowed, have learned to live without. Louis, startled by the idea, agrees to think about it.",

He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport. That luggage consisted of a high-end hunting bow and a duffel bag. Hunting bows are dangerous weapons, and when you travel from the United States to Canada with a bow, you are supposed to retrieve it and whatever other luggage you are traveling with at your initial port of entry, then escort it through customs for inspection before continuing your journey. He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up.",
