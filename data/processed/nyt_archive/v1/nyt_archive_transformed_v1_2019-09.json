In the spirit of Labor Day, revisit this outrageous black comedy about three friends who, despite working hard, are repeatedly tormented by their bosses. Their simmering grievances reach a boiling point when the buddies \\u2014 Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) \\u2014 decide to put an end to their misery by killing their higher-ups (played by Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell). Their scheme quickly falls off the rails, because, well, they\\u2019re not experienced killers. And the \\u201cmurder consultant\\u201d (Jamie Foxx) they turn to isn\\u2019t much help either. Watch with a grain of salt: In his review, the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that while the movie\\u2019s humor \\u201cflirts with racism, goes steady with misogyny and pretty much marries homophobia,\\u201d it also draws plenty of laughs.

Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie).

That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture.

After two seasons exploring the rise of the porn industry in New York in the 1970s, the third picks up in the mid 1980s. Things have changed since the characters began their journey from a corrupt and dangerous Times Square but they continue to struggle to break free from the past. In the season premiere, Vincent (played by James Franco) inches toward his estranged wife Andrea, whom he left in Season 1, while his twin brother Frankie (also played Franco) continues to display his self destructive streak despite being married and having children. But it\\u2019s not only the past that exerts a gravitational pull. The future also beckons. Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a former street prostitute who became a porn film director, disagrees with Harvey (David Krumholtz), a fellow director, about the changes affecting the industry when they travel together to a convention in Las Vegas. \",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"What\\u2019s on TV Monday: \\u2018The Deuce\\u2019 and a Monday Night Football Anniversary\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-09-09T05:00:08+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"Officials warned that climate change and drought threatened to bring Australia its worst fire season on record.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"Officials warned that climate change and drought threatened to bring Australia its worst fire season on record.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"SYDNEY, Australia \\u2014 The conservationists who built the secluded Binna Burra Lodge in Australia\\u2019s lush mountains more than 80 years ago hoped to protect and share the natural beauty of the surrounding rainforest.\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Australia Bushfires Arrive Early, Destroying Historic Lodge in \\u2018Omen\\u2019 of Future\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-09-09T05:12:01+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"Pyer Moss Spring 2020 Collection\",\n      \"snippet\": \"Pyer Moss Spring 2020 Collection\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"Pyer Moss Spring 2020 Collection\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Pyer Moss: Spring 2020\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-09-09T05:45:31+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"This word has appeared in 16 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"This word has appeared in 16 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"_________\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Word + Quiz: prognostication\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-09-09T06:00:02+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"Ms. Warren wooed wealthy donors for years, stockpiling money from fund-raisers, and has used $10.4 million from her 2018 Senate race to underwrite her 2020 bid.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"Ms. Warren wooed wealthy donors for years, stockpiling money from fund-raisers, and has used $10.4 million from her 2018 Senate race to underwrite her 2020 bid.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"On the highest floor of the tallest building in Boston, Senator Elizabeth Warren was busy collecting big checks from some of the city\\u2019s politically connected insiders.

The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeing\\u2019s largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots \\u2014 most of them recent graduates of its own academy \\u2014 and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilot\\u2019s seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte.

Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera \\u2014 his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel \\u2014 he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the \\u201970s, and there\\u2019s something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jang\\u2019s eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does) \\u2014 and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, that\\u2019s not why I find them so compelling. There\\u2019s something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white \\u2014 he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols\\u2019 Johnny Rotten\\u2019s face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantown\\u2019s Miyako Hotel. \\u201cMichael Jang\\u2019s California\\u201d is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco.
