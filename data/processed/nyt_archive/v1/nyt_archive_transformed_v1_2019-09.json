Barnum in \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d Hugh Jackman starred in this drama, which effectively posits that the former Senator Gary Hart\u2019s 1987 presidential campaign was brought down by a media circus. Directed by Jason Reitman, the movie casts Jackman as Hart. It focuses on a period of weeks that begin with Hart being widely considered the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, and ends with the politician suspending his campaign after it is overcome by rumors of extramarital activities. The film \u201cbelongs to the accusatory tradition of \u2018Ace in the Hole,\u2019 \u2018Network\u2019 and \u2018Absence of Malice,\u2019 movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering,\u201d A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. \u201cReitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion,\u201d he added. \u201cBut after a while, once we\u2019ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.\u201d",

Always on the lookout for fresh voices, the publicist read magazines like The New Leader, Commentary and The Nation, where, a few years earlier, essays and reviews by a man named James Baldwin had begun to appear with some frequency. And what Cole found in the emotionally charged writing were thoughts that sometimes \u2014 thrillingly \u2014 strained against its own gorgeous, literary, knowing style: Baldwin \u201cread,\u201d but from up high. Cole brought a few of his pieces to Knopf\u2019s editor in chief, Harold Strauss, who contacted Baldwin\u2019s agent and learned that he was at work on a novel.",

Here, inside a 1,000-square-foot space that was, in fact, previously a wine shop (they even kept the same shelves, lightening up the room by adding several Noguchi lanterns and buckets of white paint), McNany and Tarlow are selling bottles from people \u201cwho actually grow the grapes and farm the fruit,\u201d says Tarlow, whose restaurant portfolio (Diner, Roman\u2019s, Achilles Heel) has long heralded a similarly intimate, person-to-person ethos. \u201cI would say 99.9 percent of all the bottlings here are done by people who tend to their own land.\u201d",

A year after Saoirse Ronan played a pink-haired, rebellious teenager in the indie drama \u201cLady Bird,\u201d she returned to the big screen as the title character of this period drama, Mary Stuart. Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). When a young Mary returns to Scotland from France in 1561 and claims the throne, she asserts she also has the right to Elizabeth\u2019s crown. That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture. And while historians may find faults in the plot, the visuals place you right in 16th-century Britain. (The film received Oscar nominations for costume design and makeup and hairstyling.) THE FAVOURITE (2018), another historical drama about women scheming for royalty, leads in at 5:55 p.m.",

The Beyond Burger vegetarian option and the Nashville-style chicken also pass muster. Burgers are cooked to the customer\u2019s preferred doneness, and garnishes are available. The delivery area will be the Upper East Side to Lower East Side, Midtown East to Koreatown.",

The chef, Luigi Cetrulo, is from Puglia, and, as the name of the new place implies, pasta gets top billing. \u201cI make the fresh pasta, and Luigi cooks it,\u201d Mr. Priola said. The pasta-making operation is on display at the end of the restaurant\u2019s bar, at the front window. Burnt-wheat (grano arso) cavatelli, troccoli and orecchiette from Puglia share the menu with Tuscan pappardelle, Roman rigatoni alla carbonara, Sicilian paccheri and tagghiarini with cheese and prosciutto served in a wheel of cheese. Marinated anchovies, octopus, seafood skewers and lamb chops round out the menu. The narrow, simply decorated room, a few steps below street level, has a long bar and tables. (Opens Thursday) ",

While Currin\u2019s exaggerated compositions blow his figures up to kewpie-doll proportions or deflate them into a jumble of jutting elbows and toothy smiles, he renders each inch of flesh in laborious, glowing brushwork that has earned him comparisons to Dutch masters. He was, in fact, exhibited alongside the celebrated Golden Age Dutch painter Cornelis van Haarlem, at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands in 2011, just two decades after his first solo show at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 1992 (where his provocative portraits of bold older women elicited accusations of sexism but nevertheless sold out). Currin\u2019s works still draw that criticism on occasion, but not much that he depicts emerges solely from his own imagination. His subjects wash in from the flotsam of American life \u2014 kitschy souvenirs and cringey ads, screenshots and centerfolds \u2014 and it\u2019s by polishing this lowbrow commerical imagery with a high-art sheen that he manages to make obvious what others might be happy to ignore about our culture.

Years later, two female detectives (played by Toni Collette and Merritt Wever) from different police departments near Denver, Colo., team up when reports of two rapes in their jurisdictions point to a similar attacker. Their pursuit of an assailant unexpectedly leads them back to Washington, where Marie, who\u2019s been branded a liar, has lost faith in her own memory.

In third grade, this was hard to do, a feat of superior athleticism that I savored even in the absence of a witness. The bounce in my legs linked me with my favorite athletes. I wore my hair like them, too, shaved low on the sides and back and slightly higher on top with a laser-sharp part engraved on the left.

			"lead_paragraph": "Men have a far greater appetite for sex and are more attracted to pornography than women are. This is the timeworn stereotype that science has long reinforced. Alfred Kinsey, America\u2019s first prominent sexologist, published in the late 1940s and early 1950s his survey results confirming that men are aroused more easily and often by sexual imagery than women. It made sense, evolutionary psychologists theorized, that women\u2019s erotic pleasure might be tempered by the potential burdens of pregnancy, birth and child rearing \u2014 that they would require a deeper emotional connection with a partner to feel turned on than men, whose primal urge is simply procreation. Modern statistics showing that men are still the dominant consumers of online porn seem to support this thinking, as does the fact that men are more prone to hypersexuality, whereas a lack of desire and anorgasmia are more prevalent in women. So it was somewhat surprising when a paper in the prestigious journal P.N.A.S. reported in July that what happens in the brains of female study subjects when they look at sexual imagery is pretty much the same as what happens in the brains of their male counterparts.",

The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeing\u2019s largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots \u2014 most of them recent graduates of its own academy \u2014 and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilot\u2019s seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte. On the coming run, it would be his turn to do the flying.",

Like its source material, the movie tells a story that is, despite being about humans traveling beyond the confines of earth\u2019s atmosphere, supremely claustrophobic: It centers on a spaceship knocked off course, out of fuel and running out of hope. The crew of the ship, which had left an earth in environmental ruin and was bound for a human colony on Mars, includes MR (Emelie Jonsson), the story\u2019s protagonist, whose situation becomes increasingly grim. \u201cAt times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable,\u201d Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. \u201cThe film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride.

			"lead_paragraph": "Out this month \u2014 to accompany a show at the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco \u2014 is a beautiful monograph of the work of the photographer Michael Jang. Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera \u2014 his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel \u2014 he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the \u201970s, and there\u2019s something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jang\u2019s eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does) \u2014 and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, that\u2019s not why I find them so compelling. There\u2019s something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white \u2014 he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols\u2019 Johnny Rotten\u2019s face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantown\u2019s Miyako Hotel. \u201cMichael Jang\u2019s California\u201d is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco. The book \u201cWho Is Michael Jang?\u201d $65, is available now at atelier-editions.com. \u2014 THESSALY LA FORCE",

The query does a tidy job of summing up what this show does: mix procedural and supernatural thrills. \u201cEvil\u201d is the latest series from Robert and Michelle King, the married duo behind the long-running legal drama \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d The new series is led by the actress Katja Herbers, who plays Dr. Bouchard, and the actors Mike Colter (\u201cLuke Cage\u201d) and Aasif Mandvi (\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d), as an investigator and his colleague who look into potentially paranormal phenomena. In Dr. Bouchard, that pair finds a person whose expertise can help distinguish demonic possession from run-of-the-mill insanity. The first episode debuts Thursday, alongside two notable new CBS sitcoms: THE UNICORN, airing at 8:30 p.m., which casts Walton Goggins as an obliviously handsome widower wading into the dating pool, and CAROL\u2019S SECOND ACT, at 9:30 p.m., with Patricia Heaton as a retired teacher attempting to make a midlife career pivot into medicine.",
