Thomas\u2019s book made news (including a front-page New York Times profile) partly for its topical story line and partly because Thomas herself, a 29-year-old from Jackson, Miss., is so cheerfully a symbol of change in the publishing industry. Mississippi \u201chas a great literary history, but the other authors are dead or white,\u201d she told her hometown newspaper in March. \u201cAs a kid, I would wonder, \u2018Is this something that can happen to me, the little black girl from the hood?\u2019\u201d Now that it has, Thomas has become a literary ambassador of sorts, visiting classrooms and, last month, advising would-be authors at BuzzFeed how to represent traditionally underrepresented figures. One tip: Learn your stuff. \u201cIf you were writing a legal thriller but have no legal background,\u201d she said, \u201cwould you do some research? So why not do the same when approaching marginalized characters? When I was writing \u2018The Hate U Give,\u2019 I had to research gangs. I have not been in a gang nor do I have family members who have been in gangs, so I had to research it. I had to look at firsthand accounts of that culture \u2014 not just what the media portrays. I watched documentaries and consulted with attorneys. This also applies to identity. If you\u2019re writing about a gay boy or a black girl, you need to talk to a gay boy or black girl. You have to go above and beyond to get it right. The internet is a beautiful thing for a writer, but we have to put in the work. I think that\u2019s key: Put in the work. Whether you\u2019re writing about diversity or a legal thriller, you have to put in the work.\u201d Still, Thomas has found some audiences more receptive than others \u2014 a fact that led her to young adult literature in the first place. \u201cNot to throw shade or anything,\u201d she told Cosmopolitan in March, \u201cbut I feel like teenagers are much more open-minded and willing to listen.\u201d",

A storm was dumping rain at a time of year when the temperature was usually well below freezing; because the water had short-circuited the electrical system, the electric pumps on site were useless. This subterranean safe house holds more than 5,000 species of essential food crops, including hundreds of thousands of varieties of wheat and rice.

The landlord told my mother that she is \u201cnot on the lease,\u201d and since the lease renewal her husband signed is for only two years, if he should die during that time, my mother would not have a home. I do not think this can possibly be true. They\u2019ve been married for nearly 30 years. What can she do?",
