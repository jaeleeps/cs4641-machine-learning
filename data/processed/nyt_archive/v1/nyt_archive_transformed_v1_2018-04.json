After several years with the Penan, Manser became an outspoken critic of deforestation on the island, and he disappeared in 2000, presumed dead.

One such victim was Risotteria in the West Village, which Joseph Pace, an experienced chef with French training, opened in 1999 and closed two years ago. He and his wife, Adrienne Pace, left New York to travel and returned to find the city welcoming a spicier, more global, vegetable-based cuisine and Mr. Pace\u2019s former landlord \u201cready to deal,\u201d as he put it. So he is now back in his old space, and has opened this all-day restaurant serving breakfast items like a poached egg lentil bowl and eggs baked with the green Yemeni hot sauce called zhug. Hefty sandwiches on bread that\u2019s gluten-free or not, salads and main courses (served after noon) that include skirt steak, mac and cheese and leg of lamb with kofta seasonings, round out a menu that unites comfort food and Middle Eastern seasoning. The drinks list (beer and wine only) is modest in length and price. Mr. Pace\u2019s take on the \u201call day\u201d restaurant is simply done, with bare tables and wood floors: 270 Bleecker Street (Morton Street), 917-261-6479, bleeckerluncheonette.com.",

Wilson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, her stories are interested in \u201cblack U.S. citizenship, the black middle class and the future of black American life during pivotal sociopolitical moments.\u201d Below, she discusses her surprise at the tone that has developed in her work, the way she was inspired by stand-up comedians in the 1990s and more.",

Of them he wrote, \u201cthey plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvelous thing, and breathed into me a divine voice.\u201d Homer invoked the muse for his epic poem (\u201cSing to me of the man, Muse\u201d) as did Virgil. Over time, the muse became a less incantatory figure and more of a sexual one: The word is commonly used, for example, as a shorthand for the many wives and lovers Pablo Picasso captured in his work. With the rise of the model as celebrity in the latter half of the 20th century, the muse became more objectified. She could be the woman a fashion designer trusted to wear his clothes, both on and off the runway. Or she could be a figure of whom a world-famous photographer\u2019s lens never tired. These women and their looks \u2014 from Misia Sert\u2019s bohemian opulence at the turn of the last century to Twiggy\u2019s sprightly boyishness in the 1960s \u2014 can be as much an expression of their times as their era\u2019s music, literature or even politics.",

The Man of Steel struck a chord with readers and, faster than a speeding bullet, he became a multimedia sensation, with his adventures chronicled on radio, stage, film and television, and his image on a kaleidoscope of merchandise and collectibles. \u201cIf everybody doesn\u2019t know by now who Clark Kent and who Lois Lane is, you\u2019re not paying attention,\u201d said Maggie Thompson, a senior editor of the Comic Buyer\u2019s Guide, which covered the industry from 1971 to 2013. On Wednesday, Superman turns 80 years old and \u2014 great Caesar\u2019s ghost! \u2014 DC Entertainment will publish Action Comics No. 1,000. Here are some memorable issues on his journey to that milestone. Happy Birthday, Kal-El!",

Four years ago she created Lumos Bar on Houston Street, specializing in baijiu, with Orson Salicetti, a baijiu lover, behind the bar. Now she is opening Lumos Kitchen because she and Mr. Salicetti felt they had to serve more food. \u201cBaijiu is usually drunk with food,\u201d Ms. Li said. (She has since closed Lumos Bar, replacing it with Railways, a gastro pub.) Hok Chin, a Hong Kong native and a veteran of some of New York\u2019s French kitchens, including at the Essex House and the Mark Hotel, fuses French and Chinese cuisine, in dishes like pan-seared quail with foie gras in a Chinese wine sauce, black bass glazed with baijiu-miso sauce, wok-fried tiger prawns, and foie gras fried rice. To go alongside, Mr. Salicetti has come up with cocktails like a sesame colada with mangosteen, and the El Paso, combining baijiu with Lillet, lime, Sichuan pepper, cucumber and cilantro. His bar is stocked with more than 30 baijius, including some infused with herbs in-house. The airy restaurant, with splashy blue leaves decorating the walls, has a semi-open kitchen: 188 Second Avenue (12th Street), no phone, lumoskitchen.com.",

			"lead_paragraph": "With this week\u2019s selection of titles, we put ourselves into the hands of experts: expert storytellers, expert thinkers, expert biographers of expert subjects. For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Library\u2019s photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the city\u2019s rich photographic heritage \u2014 surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th century\u2019s most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers \u2014 whose new novel, \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts \u2014 and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austen\u2019s \u201cHigh-Risers,\u201d about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It\u2019s not a happy story, but it\u2019s an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well.",

According to a new Human Rights Watch report that analyzes tens of thousands of recent job advertisements, the government and private companies in China widely discriminate against women in job recruitment. Nearly one in five government job ads in 2018 called for \u201cmen only\u201d or \u201cmen preferred.\u201d Some job posts require women to have \u201cbeautiful physical features\u201d or a \u201cfine temperament.\u201d Some even demand a certain height and weight. Prominent New York Stock Exchange-listed companies like Alibaba have published recruitment ads promising applicants \u201cbeautiful girls\u201d as co-workers, labeling them \u201clate night benefits.\u201d While tech companies tout themselves as progressive to the rest of the world, these disturbing recruitment strategies show how deeply entrenched discrimination against women remains in China.",

They will serve some beers and wines, and can stir a proper martini, but that\u2019s beside the point. Their drinks are listed as nonalcoholic (sophisticated, at times sparkling, and priced at $15, the same as the alcoholic selections), carbonated, shaken, stirred straight up or on a big rock. Those in a hurry can buy bottled cocktails from vending machines with a $15 token. The ingredients they use are often extracted in a centrifuge or chilled with liquid nitrogen. But aside from such techniques, the cocktails are simple and focused, not assembled with a pantryload of components like many concoctions these days. \u201cThese drinks are all flavor-driven,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. Mr. Lee added that they intended to show off ingredients in drinks like the delicious nonalcoholic Doyenne with clarified Comice pear juice, the fresh-tasting OG Celery with gin and a blast of celery, and the satisfying Professor Plum, which is like an old-fashioned with prune-infused bourbon. Bar food, from a simple plate of fries to a steak, are the work of the executive chef Josh Eden, formerly at August. (Scheduled to open by May 18): 35 West Eighth Street, 212-203-8935. ",

This club opened up and you\u2019d be great to play your records there,\u2019\u201d he remembers. This was the era of the slick, moneyed glamour of Studio 54, and the Mudd Club was, in many ways, a reaction to it. \u201cThere were no rules \u2014 you could play a rockabilly song next to a rap song or a reggae song or the Buzzcocks or whatever it was \u2014 it all made sense and everyone danced,\u201d he said. As for the crowd, it \u201cwas just a mix of downtown kids, artists \u2026 Keith Haring, Jean-Michel [Basquiat].\u201d Strauss spent the rest of the decade spinning at big \u2014 and now shuttered \u2014 clubs like Area, the Ritz, Tunnel and Limelight.
