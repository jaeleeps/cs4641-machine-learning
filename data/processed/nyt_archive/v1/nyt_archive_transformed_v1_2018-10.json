Or a staff member can lend a hand. (Prices are $16 to $125 if they do the fishing, and $12 to $110 if you fish.) The chefs then prepare the seafood to order, salt-grilled, simmered in soy sauce, sashimi or tempura. Whimsically instructive menu cards provide guidance. The restaurant, which has 13 locations in Japan, was introduced there in 1993 by a company called Harbor House: The New York restaurant is its first branch outside that country. Takuya Takahashi, whose father was the founder, is president of the New York branch. A narrow but soaring space, the restaurant has a fish tank opposite the bar on the ground floor, and two more tanks on a loftlike second floor. The hull of an immense, hand-built polished wooden boat hangs from the ceiling. In addition to the freshly caught seafood, the menu offers a vast array of Japanese standbys, mostly seafood, including salads, sushi, hand rolls and rice and noodle dishes. (Opens Monday)",

It is told by an unnamed narrator who recounts struggling with the decision of whether to have children with her partner, Johannes. (In real life, Ms. Greengrass has two young children.) Told in patient, psychologically complex prose, \u201cSight\u201d combines the narrator\u2019s thoughts about her own mother, who died several years earlier, and her remembrances of her grandmother, a psychoanalyst, with her relevant digressions about scientific history. (Real-life figures contemplated in the book include Sigmund Freud; Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who discovered X-rays; and John Hunter, an 18th-century surgeon and anatomist.) The narrator\u2019s thoughts about having children undergirds the story, but the novel is also concerned with the nature of grief, selfhood and memory.

Johnson, a German novelist following Proustian footsteps, wrote a novel in the form of daily diary entries, covering August 1967 to August 1968.

(Harper Perennial, paper, $16.99.) The 1990s was a decade that produced a long line of vilified women \u2014 from Anita Hill to Monica Lewinsky \u2014 and, Yarrow contends, we need to understand that moment in feminist history to appreciate our own. NIGHT TRAIN By Thom Jones. (Little, Brown, $28.)

LESSONS FROM A DARK TIME By Adam Hochschild. (University of California, $27.95.)

The ground floor has a central bar and seats all around, with a fairly intimate 40-seat dining room off to one side. It\u2019s just the beginning, since downstairs, the spacious main dining room can accommodate 130 people with an appetite not just for seafood, as at Kyma, but also for what the director of operations, Joe Ragonese, describes as \u201cmore traditional, Greek home cooking.\u201d The chef, David Perez, was at Estiatorio Milos. There are braised gigantes beans with tomatoes and feta, roasted cauliflower fritters and grilled sausages among the starters, in addition to raw-bar items and the typical spreads like skordalia. Main courses are split about 50-50 meat to fish. \u201cWe think it will be a different clientele in this location,\u201d Mr. Ragonese said. \u201cAnd we also think that what Elea offers would be easier to replicate in other neighborhoods.\u201d The room is done in beige accented with white, with vintage pottery accents.",

One of the six cover subjects of T\u2019s 2018 Greats issue, she is among the most radically innovative artists working today. In a career spanning nearly five decades \u2014 working across photography, video, installations and public art campaigns \u2014 Weems has laid bare the historical biases that guide our own actions and shape our perceptions of others. Take, for example, her series \u201cMuseums\u201d (2006\u2013present), in which the artist stares down the pyramidal glass portal to the Louvre, the sinuous curves of the Guggenheim Bilbao, and the august colonnade of the British Museum, as though to challenge the institutions that have long determined what counts as culture and beauty. In this project, and in the dozens more that comprise her practice, Weems addresses questions of power, violence, exclusion, access and authority \u2014 especially as they pertain to race and gender \u2014 and dares her viewers to do the same. The pathos in all of her works, from intimate photographs of her family to series involving archival images of enslaved Africans, unites her subjects and viewers in a common humanity.",

Another source, KC Cattle Company, in Weston, Mo., is run by and employs only veterans. Ten percent of the profits go to veterans\u2019 causes. The company was started by Patrick Montgomery after his military service and raises all its own cattle. I compared several cuts of Wagyu from both companies. All were delectably tender, but I found that the KC Cattle strip steak had more umami-like complexity than Mishima Reserve, which had a simpler beefy flavor. The Mishima Reserve rib-eye cap, which comes in several grades, could not be beat. KC Cattle offers more big cuts for roasting and braising, while Mishima Reserve is a better source for interesting steaks like the zabuton (Denver steak). Both companies ship their beef frozen.",

LOVECRAFT By H. P. Lovecraft, adapted by I. N. J. Culbard. (SelfMadeHero, $35.) Culbard, a graphic novelist, offers his take on four stories from H. P. Lovecraft, the writer Stephen King called \u201cthe 20th century\u2019s greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.\u201d These stories of madness and surreal worlds are rendered here with the crispness and energy of a comic book. THE VAMPIRE By Nick Groom. (Yale, $25.) Two hundred years after the bloodsucking creature first appeared in literature, Groom presents an authoritative take on the history of the vampire. He tracks its origin to the 18th century and rumors about vampirism that led proponents of the new science to investigate and scrutinize and fantasize about this monster. THE MANSION By Ezekiel Boone. (Emily Bestler/Atria, $26.) A successful programmer decides to resurrect a failed project from his idealistic youth: inventing a computer that can control every function of a house. The only problem is that people keep dying, thanks to the evil in the code. SLUM WOLF By Tadao Tsuge. (New York Review Comics, paper, $22.95.)
