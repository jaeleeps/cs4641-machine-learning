When it debuts on April 12, Palazzo Daniele, a new hotel in the village of Gagliano del Capo, will offer travelers a more luxurious and design-oriented alternative. The nine-room property occupies the family palazzo of the art philanthropist Francesco Petrucci, built in 1861. He has teamed up with Gabriele Salini, the hotelier behind the intimate 10-suite G-Rough hotel in Rome. The two met one summer at the Capo d\\u2019Arte contemporary art fair, which Petrucci organizes, and connected over a shared passion for design. Not long after, they hired the Milanese design studio Palomba Serafini Associati to strip the neo-Classical building, which comprises two wings wrapped around a colonnaded courtyard, back to its core, preserving its vaulted ceilings, weathered stucco walls, ornate frescoes and original tile floors before layering in minimalist furniture and contemporary art including light boxes by the Roman artist Simon d\\u2019Exea and a large basin by the Italian artist Andrea Sala in which guests can shower.\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"T Suggests: A Hotel in a Palazzo, Limited-Edition Artists\\u2019 Prints and More\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-04-05T22:49:35+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"For those who want to regulate women\\u2019s bodies, ignorance has been no obstacle.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"For those who want to regulate women\\u2019s bodies, ignorance has been no obstacle.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"A few recent news stories have served as reminders that an awful lot of people lack even a basic understanding of the female body.
