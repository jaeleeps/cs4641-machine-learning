			"lead_paragraph": "\u201cInsensitive to red,\u201d a heartbreaking phrase, is technically a description of early black-and-white film, which converted the colors of blood and red lipstick to black. Elsa Lanchester\u2019s lips were painted redder than her auburn hair for 1935\u2019s \u201cThe Bride of Frankenstein\u201d; the makeup artist on the film based her look on a 3,300-year-old bust of Nefertiti, who announced her power by blackening her eyes, reddening her lips and dyeing her nails with dark henna. But when Lanchester appeared on screen as the Bride \u2014 \u201cShe\u2019s alive!\u201d \u2014 her overdrawn mouth looked dark as hell: Et voil\u00e0, the modern gothic lip was born. Robert Smith of the Cure, whose lipstick emphasized not the Cupid\u2019s bow but the corners of his mouth, giving him the moue of a dissatisfied cannibal, was said to inspire the almost-black \u201cgoth lip\u201d of the 1990s; he only, in fact, wore the \u201960s designer Mary Quant\u2019s Crimson Scorcher. But what are facts when it comes to what we see? Color depends on perception, and our perception, so dependent on lighting, changes over the years the way light does over the course of a day. Sometimes we\u2019re desensitized to red, and so to get a look as fresh as red lipstick used to give, we turn to shades that look more like ink.",

Her credentials are impeccable: She\u2019s a former \u00e9toile ballerina and was one of the most sought-after dancers in the world until ending her performance career in May 2015. As a dancer, Dupont called the Paris Opera home for 32 years \u2014 and with a 350-year-old legacy that makes it the oldest of its kind, the company is where ballet was born. But Dupont argues that in no way does this prevent it from remaining relevant to contemporary audiences. \u201cClassical dance is an extraordinarily precise and physical art form,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Chanel handbag \u2014 it endures through the generations. The old steps of \u2018Swan Lake\u2019 can be danced in ways which make them new. Just like your grandmother\u2019s Chanel can be worn with sneakers in order to keep it modern.\u201d",

Yet, I also noted a crucial difference between the two: \u201cA Prophet\u201d is about how a system predicated on reform turns a petty criminal into violent monster, but we don\u2019t know if the same is true of Naz. There are suggestions, based on his behavior and based on the real possibility that he murdered Andrea Cornish, that prison hasn\u2019t changed Naz so much as revealed the coarsened soul that his good-guy demeanor has hidden so effectively.",

For weeks we watched the turkey \u2014 our turkey \u2014 on the farmer\u2019s webcam, a cluster of pixels frolicking inside a chicken-wire enclosure. It was butchered and shipped overnight (the FedEx shipping cost nearly as much as the bird) and when it emerged from the oven, mari\u00adnated and basted decadently in butter, the turkey tasted so unspeakably bland that much of it was left on our friends\u2019 plates, camouflaged awkwardly under brussels sprouts. The feel-good narrative of our lovingly raised, hormone-antibiotic-and-G.M.O.-free certified-organic turkey became supplanted with a more ambiguous one. We felt both duped and morally abject: Not only were we out nearly $200, but our ethical gambit put an end to the bird\u2019s bucolic life.",

After parting ways with his longtime coach Goran Ivanisevic, Cilic hired Jonas Bjorkman to help strengthen his forehand and his return, both of which let him down in crucial moments against Federer at Wimbledon. Against Murray at Cincinnati, Cilic returned brilliantly.

It\u2019s good news for those authors and their publishers, not so encouraging for the increasing number of people who would like to make a living from writing. And of course it raises the intriguing question: Even when well translated, can we really understand what other cultures are talking about? Will a housewife in Tibet (assuming there are \u201chousewives\u201d in Tibet) make sense of Jonathan Franzen\u2019s St.\u202fPaul, Minn.? Can other people truly get the hang of Bulgarian etiquette or courtship in Laos or street life in the Philippines? Are we interested? Does it make sense to be interested?

The organization hosts its annual open house with a day of free activities on Saturday, Sept. 10, beginning at 9 a.m. with coffee and pastries. (Dancing does require sustenance.) Events continue throughout the day with classes for children and adults in a wide variety of styles: ballet, modern, Gaga, salsa, tap and Afro-Caribbean. Participants will also have the opportunity to learn sections from Mr. Morris\u2019s holiday classic, \u201cThe Hard Nut,\u201d which returns to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in December. But for those who prefer to watch, there is a special attraction: The Mark Morris Dance Group will perform Mr. Morris\u2019s ravishing 1995 dance \u201cPacific\u201d at 1 and 3 p.m. After each performance, there will be appearances by students from the company\u2019s Urban Rhythms and Arts Immersion programs. And there\u2019s a beer garden, courtesy of Sixpoint Brewery, on the center\u2019s fourth-floor terrace. Cross your fingers for sun. (mmdg.org/openhouse.)",

But the most intimate moments are the ones where she stands totally alone, forcing everyone\u2019s gaze right on her. Kanye West has a similar strategy in mind on his Saint Pablo Tour, with a different approach. He has done away with a traditional stage altogether and instead delivers his performance atop a set of platforms hovering over the crowd. It places him eerily close to almost the whole audience, but it also isolates him, a hero and a loner.
