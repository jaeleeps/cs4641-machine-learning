It has raised nearly $40,000 from individuals and corporate sponsors since it was released on June 11. Steve Wilson, an alumnus who is spearheading the campaign and edited the book, said that they would soon release the current edition in Spanish, and that they were planning for a second volume. Some of the recipes in the current book include Filipino lumpia, Egyptian mulukhiyah soup, Finnish meat pies, and kugel.",

Surrounded by promenades with views across the East River to Brooklyn, its rooftop, open year-round, has a collection of cabana-like pods set on patches of faux lawn for dining and drinking throughout the day. There are 28 of them, each accommodating up to eight people, to be reserved in advance. They\u2019re equipped with umbrellas, lounge chairs, coolers and USB ports, and you can order from your smartphone. The pods require reservations; two other areas, a north patio and south patio, are first-come, first-served. The menu for the entire rooftop consists of fruity cocktails, some of them slushy, and food like fish and chips, organic chicken sandwiches, and salmon and squash kebabs. On the pier\u2019s ground level, one restaurant, Malibu Farm, will open for outdoor dining on Thursday. The Fulton by Jean-Georges Vongerichten is opening soon, along with David Chang\u2019s Momofuku Ssam Bar, moving into the Bar Wayo space. Another restaurant on the pier, Carne Mare from Andrew Carmellini, which was supposed to make its debut in April, has yet to announce an opening date. ",

A bride sat onstage in a traditional white lace gown before a banquet of Persian pastries and urns overflowing with pastel-colored roses and baby\u2019s breath.

An older community leader in a black suit presided over the faux ceremony in Farsi, as the viewers sat divided by gender \u2014 men on one side of the aisle, women on the other, though the men outnumbered the women and ended up infringing on their section. This was a deliberate move on Farzaneh\u2019s part intended to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry \u2014 where a woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity \u2014 and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a procession of young men dressed in looks from the fall 2020 collection of Farzaneh\u2019s namesake line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles.",

Refreshing cucumber vodka is new, and they\u2019re also distilling potato-based whiskey-style aged spirits called Single Spuds. All the products are available for sampling and purchase at the bright tasting room they opened a few months ago in an old barn adjacent to the distillery.

Its first canned drinks are labeled Can 01 (10 percent alcohol) and Can 02 (8 percent alcohol). These lightly carbonated drinks are blends of ingredients like oolong tea, gooseberries, sour cherry, black currant buds and walnut wood. In Can 01, a mixture the color of ripe chardonnay is a smooth, lightly fruity quaff, with tea and gooseberries at its base. Can 02 has a deep ruby color, is fairly tannic and delivers tart fruit from sour cherries and black currant buds.",

It\u2019s actually hot-smoked, very gently, so it retains exquisite succulence instead of the dry texture usually associated with hot-smoked salmon. The company also makes silky cold-smoked salmon. The 3.5-ounce fillets come beechwood roasted, plain, and also seasoned with chile and lime, or crusted with pepper and spices. A fourth variety, Double Manuka, roasted over manuka wood and seasoned with manuka honey, is extremely rich. The fillets each make a nice single serving and are excellent at room temperature. Through Sept. 30, 10 percent of sales through Amazon will be donated to Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019s World Central Kitchen, which supports restaurants and people in need of food.",

In Sarah\u2019s apartment, where she kept the tall sliding windows open, she felt the gusts even in her sleep, the geckos hunting on her walls scattering, moving toward the ceiling and its deeper shadow. She dreamed that she was swimming in an indoor pool back in New York, at the old YWCA near Fifty-Third Street, alone and chilled, until a siren wailed in the distance and the pool disintegrated. Her eyes opened, the equator returned, and the sweat on her back failed to dry. She panicked for a moment and felt for the edge of her mattress to situate herself. What day was it? Koel birds called out across the city, whooping laments, and at once she remembered the waste lots of jungle below her windows with their listing flame trees alongside the ruined tobacco warehouses that had stood there since the Japanese occupation. A faint hum came from the stormy Saen Saep Canal nearby, its black water churning with dawn commuter boats. She was alone among the flies, and the moon was still high above the dirty white skyscrapers of Bangkok.",

Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community.",

Then there\u2019s Louis Vuitton\u2019s signature monogram canvas, with its interlaced L and V flanked by various geometric flowers, which seems to be another thing entirely, one impervious to trends and maybe even time itself. In fact, the monogram hasn\u2019t always been around, nor does it date to the house\u2019s founding in 1854, when Louis Vuitton, who had previously been a packer for Empress Eug\u00e9nie, the wife of Napoleon III, began selling travel trunks out of a store on Paris\u2019s Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, just off Place Vend\u00f4me. His go-to motif was a waterproof gray canvas. The monogram came into existence just over four decades later, when Louis\u2019s son, Georges, took inspiration from the kitchen tiles of the family\u2019s home in Asni\u00e8res in north-central France. The house, built in 1859, was decorated in the Art Nouveau style, and the tile pattern featured a trio of flowers outlined by a clover that was in turn set within a circle, as well as diamonds with petal-like points. Another reference may have been the Gothic Revival then sweeping through France \u2014 when seen through that lens, the monogram can\u2019t help but recall architectural quatrefoils carved out of stone or glass in the era\u2019s great cathedrals. What is certain is that, in designing it, Georges was acting in honor of his father, who had died four years prior, leaving the brand\u2019s legacy in his son\u2019s hands.",

I am not Black, but I keenly remember the discomfort and inexplicable shame I often felt while attending my freshman-year public high school, Robert E. Lee, in Tyler, Texas. Lee was a Confederate general, a slave owner and a commander in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. (The middle school I attended in Tyler, Hubbard, was also named for a former Confederate officer, who later became the state\u2019s governor.) A large portrait of Lee hung in the school gym, and whenever I saw it, I felt as if my right to this country, to Americanness, was being challenged.

Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, the world-famous drug lord, had hired a young IT guy and the kid had built him a sophisticated system of high-end cell phones and secret servers, all of it ingeniously encrypted. The unconfirmed report\u2014perhaps that was the best way to describe it\u2014had arrived that Friday in June 2009 when a tipster walked into the lobby of the FBI\u2019s field division office in New York. After his story had been vetted downstairs, it made its way up seven flights of stairs and landed with a curious thud among the crowded cubicles of C-23, the Latin American drug squad. For more than thirty years, the elite team of agents and their bosses had hunted some of the drug trade\u2019s biggest criminals, and while tall tales of their antics circulated constantly through its squad room near the courts in Lower Manhattan, no one in the unit knew what to make of this one. The tipster\u2019s account seemed credible enough but it was sorely lacking details: the only facts he had offered on the young technician were a first name\u2014Christian\u2014and that he was from Medell\u00edn, Colombia. All sorts of kooks spouting all sorts of nonsense showed up all the time at FBI facilities, claiming they had inside information on the Kennedy killing or knew someone who knew someone who knew where Jimmy Hoffa was. In what were still the early days of Internet telephony, it seemed a bit far-fetched that a twentysomething hacker had reached a deal with the world\u2019s most wanted fugitive and furnished him in hiding with a private form of Skype. As alluring as it sounded, it was just the sort of thing that would probably turn out to be a myth.",
