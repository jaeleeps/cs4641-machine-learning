These were largely (though not exclusively) midcentury dwellings \u2014 some neglected, others wildly overgrown \u2014 on or in the park that seemed to reify my sense of the city\u2019s layered strangeness, of its mystery and opportunity for discovery. Even more than other European cities, Berlin is marked by the remains of all kinds of ideologies past, from the TV Tower in the vast main square, Alexanderplatz, a retro-future icon erected in the late 1960s by the East German government in a now poignant display of might, to the buildings the Nazis left behind. (Hitler never did fully realize his vision of a rebuilt Berlin as the capital of \u201cGermania,\u201d but the kind of neo-Classical bombast he had in mind is evident in the Olympic Stadium, which he commissioned shortly after he took power in 1933 and was completed in time for the 1936 Summer Games, and the limestone Tempelhof Airport terminal, which was constructed between 1936 and 1941 and, following the war, became a site of the airlift that sustained the city with food and supplies when Stalin blocked access to West Berlin.) All architecture conveys a set of narratives, histories and values for how best to live, and today\u2019s Berlin, a jumble of tragedy and utopian ambitions past \u2014 and, these days, encroaching foreign investment \u2014 can feel like an especially dark choose-your-own-adventure story.",

In 1917, he flipped over a couple of discarded photographs and sketched a folding screen, coloring it with tempera and pencil. The drawing remained unpublished until it appeared in a 1968 Balla monograph, but now Cassina has produced the partition, silk-screened on both sides of an asymmetrically cut wooden armature with satin-brass hinges. The colors pictured here are those that Balla himself specified: a smoldering combination of cinnabar, citron and deep forest. (Another iteration is available in blues and sage green on a white background.) The future, it seems, with all its vivid contradictions, has arrived at last.",

All motifs benefit from ingenious combinations of strident drawing and suave stained color; they are often simultaneously transparent and opaque, explicit and mysterious.

That ginseng improves energy, say, or that ginger alleviates nausea, or that horsetail, which contains silica, might help hair to grow? One theory, possibly apocryphal and certainly much maligned by modern medicine, is that the physical characteristics of plants themselves provided clues as to how they might be used. This notion, known among scholars of ethnobotany and practitioners of herbal medicine as the doctrine of signatures, holds that plants have a \u201csignature\u201d \u2014 color, texture, shape, scent, even the environment in which they grow \u2014 that resembles the body parts and diseases they heal. Thus bloodroot, or Sanguinaria canadensis, whose roots and rhizomes secrete a red sap when cut, was once thought to heal blood disorders and hasten wound healing. And eyebright, or euphrasia, whose flowers resemble the human eye (or rather, with its yellow dots and purple stripes, a jaundiced, bloodshot one), has for centuries been used to treat ocular ailments, like conjunctivitis. (In German, eyebright is called Augentrost, or \u201cconsolation of the eyes.\u201d) Signatures, in other words, made it easy to divine a plant\u2019s medicinal properties.

			"lead_paragraph": "There is, arguably, never a bad time to send flowers. But in a year marked by both isolation and turmoil, a delivery of blooms, a gift that also helps support financially hard-hit small businesses, feels especially poignant. And so for the first in our new series of Black Book guides, we\u2019ve created a directory of the most imaginative and masterful florists working today in six major cities. These 22 designers make arrangements that are often wildly different in style, ranging from understated bouquets to experimental showpieces, and we\u2019ve tried to offer a range of \u201cclassic,\u201d \u201cearthy\u201d and \u201cunusual\u201d options in each place. But if these florists\u2019 aesthetics are diverse \u2014 informed by everything from old master paintings to modern dance \u2014 they all bring a singular vision to the centuries-old art they practice. Many are also united in rejecting the methods of the contemporary globalized flower trade, in which blooms are cut sometimes months before they\u2019re sold, sprayed with toxic preservatives and then shipped great distances at great environmental cost. Some are instead championing local growers and avoiding harmful substances like flower foam, while others are even cultivating their own flowers or privileging historically overlooked materials such as seedpods, roots and weeds. At the bottom of this article you\u2019ll find a downloadable guide with delivery information that we hope will serve as a useful, and much turned to, resource.",

Stacks of boxes filled with books and products she\u2019d made, as well as paintings \u2014 both her own and ones she\u2019d purchased \u2014 lined the walls, and the countertops of the kitchenette were barely visible beneath the countless cases of spray paint piled on top of them.

And so, in May, she bought a bike and a rack for her car and began taking road trips to rural areas outside of the city to find some relief from all the time spent indoors. Inspired in part by these excursions, Abney\u2019s new body of work conveys a sense of expansiveness \u2014 one that she also found in the form of an additional studio that she rented in the same building this fall. This larger temporary space, with a view of the Manhattan skyline, gave the artist enough room to finish the 22 paintings \u2014 ranging from 2 feet by 2 feet to 8 feet by 8 feet \u2014 that are currently on display in \u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d a solo exhibition at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York.",

The coronavirus has entered a frightening new stage nationwide \u2014 triggering school districts around the country to shutter, including in New York City and the entire state of Kentucky \u2014 and putting San Francisco on the horns of a dilemma.The district\u2019s goal of opening some schools could bring relief to thousands of parents and students, but their plan was written for another reality. Virus rates are suddenly spiking, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday to issue a nighttime curfew affecting nearly every county in the state, though San Francisco is below the threshold. As a result, officials here face pushback from some unions, teachers and parents.Whether San Francisco ultimately proceeds can be a bellwether: If schools cannot reopen here where virus rates remain comparatively low, what hope do other cities have for a return to something resembling normalcy?There is mounting evidence that prolonged distance learning could have long-term effects on schoolchildren and their families, including higher dropout rates and lower income in later years. Parents and caretakers have suffered, too, as homebound schooling has caused many to alter their work lives, disproportionately affecting women, minorities and the underprivileged.",

The current owners turned it back into a single-family residence and updated the plumbing, electrical and HVAC systems. The house is about two blocks from the Clark Kerr Campus of the University of California, Berkeley; the school\u2019s main campus is 10 minutes away.
