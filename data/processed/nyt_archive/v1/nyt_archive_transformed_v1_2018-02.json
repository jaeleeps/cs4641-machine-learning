Bowler, a professor at Duke Divinity School, had a perspective-altering experience at 35 when she learned she had late-stage colon cancer.

Using a trove of documents from a Swiss publisher that smuggled illegal works over the border, he is able to piece together a complex network that put subversive books in the hands of French men and women.",

That\u2019s because the owner, Ed Raven, who also owns Greenpoint Beer & Ale nearby, is running the restaurant under a farm brewery license from the state. It permits him to serve beer by the glass without a separate license and, as a brewery owner, to open an off-premises restaurant or retail establishment. Mr. Raven has also collaborated with North Brooklyn Farms in Williamsburg for many of the ingredients used by the three chefs, each of whom has a specialty. Christian Perkins, who worked at Marlow & Daughters, is the butcher. Emma Jane Gonzalez, a vegan, and the omnivorous Kenneth Monroe come from North Brooklyn Farms. Their menu features seafood, steaks, sausages and vegetable specialties like charred sweet potatoes with kale and tahini, celery root with apples and crispy nori, and a green chile stew. Seats are at marble tables and a long, circular bar: 544 Manhattan Avenue (Driggs Avenue), Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 718-599-1556, annickanyc.com.",

On social media and elsewhere, a 2003 sexual assault case against Mr. Bryant (which was later dismissed) was cited as a reason not to honor the movie.

Directed by Glen Keane, the movie is an autobiographical sketch in which Mr. Bryant thanks basketball \u2014 both the object and the game \u2014 for the life he devoted to it. The animation, rendered in modes of pencils and pastels, has a gorgeous fluency to be sure. The score is by none other than John Williams, American cinema\u2019s king of the Heroic Theme.

It is laid with plates that rise a few inches off the table, as if levitating, each one sumptuously painted with wings or petals or licks of flame emanating from a glowing center: variations on the vulva. As you move along the table, which is 48 feet long on each side, the plates become small sculptures, bulbous and gleaming. Beneath them are runners embroidered with elaborate designs and names in gold thread \u2014 women of accomplishment who are familiar and unfamiliar, mythical and rarely spoken of: Sappho, the ancient poet; Anna Maria van Schurman, the 17th-century artist, thinker and theologian; Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female physician in the United States. The whole assemblage stands on a floor of luminescent triangular tiles covered in more gold \u2014 999 names of other heroic women written in curling letters. The room is like a temple \u2014 a holy place, distinct from the everyday.",

Cramer \u2014 a producer of television shows including \u201cDynasty\u201d and \u201cThe Love Boat\u201d \u2014 asked the artist Ellsworth Kelly to design a free-standing structure on his vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif. Cramer was a loyal collector of the artist, and wanted Kelly to make an original, large-scale artwork for his property. Kelly, who died in December 2015 at the age of 92 and whose career was defined by stripping painting and sculpture down to their elemental components of form and color, made designs for what appears from the outside to be a simple double-barrel-vaulted building, alluding to Romanesque and Cistercian religious architecture and resembling an igloo made of stucco. Inside, the artist had planned for a number of revelations. Colored-glass windows \u2014 arranged as a grid over the entrance, as a ring of tumbling squares on one side of the building, and a sunburst on the other \u2014 would bend the light in different ways. On the walls was Kelly\u2019s take on the stations of the cross \u2014 14 marble panels, variations on stark black-and-white abstractions. In the rear of this single-room structure, where one would expect to find the crucifix in a Christian church, would be one of Kelly\u2019s totem sculptures \u2014 a thin column standing over the interior like a sentinel. The project eventually fell through; Kelly kept two models of the structure in his studio, though he never really believed the chapel would be built.",

She also must confront some terrifying Islamophobia, just as Ahmed herself once did. \u201cMy first experience with Islamophobia was during the Iran hostage crisis,\u201d Ahmed says, describing how a man began hurling obscenities at her. \u201cI was a young child. I was stunned, truly frozen. I had never heard that kind of language, had never had that kind of hate directed at me. It was a shattering moment, an event that changed my worldview.\u201d She adds: \u201cThat is part of what I wanted to capture in \u2018Love, Hate & Other Filters\u2019 \u2014 that moment when a young person\u2019s life is shattered by an event that has nothing to do with them.\u201d Maya\u2019s main narrative is shot through with a secondary tale, an unfolding act of domestic terrorism. \u201cThat story was inspired by two very specific references,\u201d Ahmed explains, \u201cthe interstitial chapters in \u2018The Grapes of Wrath\u2019 in terms of craft and structure, and a line from \u2018In Cold Blood,\u2019 by Truman Capote: \u2018Presently, the car crept forward.\u2019 That inspired the tone, the tension I wanted to capture.\u201d",

Apart from Bottura\u2019s five nonprofit Food for Soul soup kitchens, Gucci Osteria is the triple-Michelin-starred chef\u2019s first restaurant beyond his native Modena. It\u2019s still a hometown collaboration, though, as Gucci C.E.O. Marco Bizzarri is an old friend from high school. There\u2019s also a natural affinity between him and Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, both of whom specialize in artful deconstructions of the past. \u201cWe\u2019re looking back not in a nostalgic way but to create something new,\u201d Bottura says. \u201cItalians have the gene of the artisan and the poet.\u201d Yet the restaurant is not strictly Italian: Its menu features such varied dishes as lingua in salsa verde and grilled lettuce (above), steamed Japanese buns with pork belly and apple, and even a hot dog made with Tuscany\u2019s prized Chianina beef. \u2014 LAURA RYSMAN",

The only Peruvian ever to have won a Nobel Prize, Vargas Llosa now lives in an eight-bedroom mansion on the fringes of Madrid, in the neighborhood known as Puerta de Hierro. When I arrived, a butler in a white jacket led me through the enormous two-story foyer, across gleaming black and white tiles, into a library lined with dark wood bookcases. A crystal ashtray sat next to silver dishes of chocolate and cigarettes. This imposing casona seemed like a fitting residence for the last living giant of a golden age of Latin American literature, a man who may well be the most politically important novelist of our time, but the house does not belong to Vargas Llosa. Over the library\u2019s fireplace hung a portrait of its owner, Isabel Preysler, in a red dress.",

In his view, the former F.B.I. director James Comey\u2019s announcement, 11 days before the vote, that Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were under investigation again, dealt the fatal blow. MAKING THE MONSTER By Kathryn Harkup. (Sigma, $27.) Could Victor Frankenstein actually have succeeded in 1818, building a man out of spare parts? That was the year that Mary Shelley published her classic novel, and Harkup looks at the science behind the 19th-century culture of experimentation with dead bodies to which it was responding. SISTER OF DARKNESS By R. H. Stavis with Sarah Durand. (Dey St., $26.99.) Yes, there are such things as \u201csecular exorcists.\u201d Stavis is one (along with being, fittingly, a screenwriter of horror movies). After helping what she says are thousands of people expel their demons, she has decided here to speak of her unique power. CHICAGO By David Mamet. (Custom House, $26.99.) The combustible playwright and screenwriter turns once again to fiction in his fourth novel, set in 1920s Chicago among small-time crooks and aspiring mobsters. It has all the trademarks of a Mamet production \u2014 electric dialogue and a hurtling pace. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH HUMANKIND By Sang-Hee Lee. (Norton, $26.95.) Lee, a paleoanthropologist, tells us much about our evolutionary origins by sorting through our ancestors\u2019 mortal remains. Examining wisdom teeth from various periods, for example, she was able to establish how long ago our life spans first allowed us to know our grandparents.

The restaurant, named for the recording studio once housed at its address, is starting with a breakfast and lunch cafe in the front half of the space, serving what Mr. Hardy calls \u201cchef-driven food,\u201d not the usual muffins and egg sandwiches. It has a handsome sweep of bar for drinks and dining, and a marble bar for wine, with comfortable seating. By night this area will become a wine bar and dining counter with the same menu as the airy dining room beyond. The design, by Ken Fulk of San Francisco, suggests midcentury modern. The dinner menu is what Mr. Hardy calls \u201cmore uptown\u201d than those at his other restaurants, with less Neapolitan fire, more Piedmontese complexity and a greater focus on seafood. The winter menu has a crudo section and dishes like crispy sunchokes with puntarelle, chestnut tagliatelle with duck rag\u00f9 and duck offal, and Icelandic sea trout with pickled fennel and horseradish. Arvid Rosengren, an award-winning sommelier, is a partner here and has assembled a mostly French and Italian wine list. Upstairs is another bar with a lively mural to set the scene, and Jeff Bell of PDT consulting on the drinks.

Things looked very different for Thomas as recently as last summer. Back then, he was the star gunner for the Boston Celtics, and he was becoming something of a folk hero in the city. But then in August, the organization abruptly traded him to the Cavs for Kyrie Irving. At the time of the first trade, Thomas was just months off a colossal playoff run in which he played through major dental surgery, a hip labral tear and the loss of his younger sister, Chyna, in a car accident. In the days after her death, Thomas suited up against the Bulls: He had Chyna\u2019s name written on his sneakers and fat tears pooled in his eyes. And then, as he\u2019d done for years, Thomas \u2014 the shortest man in the N.B.A. \u2014 scored bunches of points with an intricate, endless string of feints, jabs and soft, soft jumpers.",

As he sits in their kitchen, the camera slinking about, Lena\u2019s surprise gives way to happiness and then to mounting wariness that, like some kind of contagion, soon slithers under your skin. To understand what has happened and why, Lena sets off on a heroic journey, one that \u2014 like most such adventures \u2014 inevitably leads inward with each searching step.",

Instead, he drilled a hole in a piece of the set called a tormentor flat, about waist-high, so that he and his eight castmates, standing backstage, could get a glimpse of whoever was sitting sixth row center: the best seats in the house.
