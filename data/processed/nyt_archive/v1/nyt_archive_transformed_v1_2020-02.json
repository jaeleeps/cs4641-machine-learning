Marilyn Monroe shines in this classic romantic comedy by Billy Wilder. She plays Sugar, a performer who catches the eye of two men, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon), when they join her traveling band for its trip to Miami. The problem is that Joe and Jerry have disguised themselves as women in order to escape the gangsters who are pursuing them in Chicago. To keep safe they have to maintain their false identities, but as long as they do, neither can pursue Sugar. Joe tries to get around this issue by reinventing himself as Junior, an heir to an oil fortune. Regarded now as a cinematic treasure for its meticulous construction and timeless laughs, the film is also notable for including several music performances by Monroe.",

No one consulted me beforehand, and I can\u2019t see why I should be asked to provide an opinion on the subject now. I was roughly as afraid of the Rapture as I was of being the last person in the house who left the basement at nighttime and had to turn the lights out before I went up the stairs \u2013 it felt variously real and ridiculous depending on how close I was to being alone. Afternoons where I was the first person to come home after school and the neighborhood seemed slightly emptier than usual were ideal for Rapture practice, for seeing if I could gin up sufficient panic and remorse at the prospect of being unscooped; playing DC Talk\u2019s cover of \u201cI Wish We\u2019d All Been Ready\u201d sometimes helped, but more often than not just made me even more self-conscious of having to trick myself into getting in the mood.",

			"lead_paragraph": "In food, fermentation \u2014 the process by which enzymes from microorganisms break down carbohydrates \u2014 is both an ancient practice and a recent trend. Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last December\u2019s Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the city\u2019s diversity of dwellers that he\u2019d brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms. (Also see the Toronto-based curator Lauren Fournier\u2019s ongoing series examining fermentation through a feminist lens, which led to the 2019 book \u201cCritical Booch.\u201d)",

What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film \u201chas a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact,\u201d A.O.

The Met has never before presented an exhibition of art from the West Indies, and it concentrates here on the ritual objects \u2014 thrones, vessels and mysterious bird-shaped stones \u2014 of the Ta\u00edno people, who inhabited the islands now called Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Turks and Caicos. On these islands, and on the Caribbean-facing coasts of Central America, styles mingled and migrated, and art had both religious and diplomatic functions; one extravagant gold pendant here, in the shape of a bird with splayed wings and zigzagging necklaces, traveled from Panama all the way to the Antilles. As the Met begins renovations of its Rockefeller Wing, the Caribbean offers its curators a priceless model of how to think about world cultures: never \u201cpure\u201d but in constant motion and constant contact, diffracted across time and oceans.

THE STRANGE LOVE STORIES OF OGDEN WHITNEY (New York Review Comics, 112 pp., $19.95), edited by the comics aficionado Dan Nadel and the cartoonist Frank Santoro (\u201cPittsburgh\u201d). As detailed in Nadel\u2019s afterword, Whitney was born in 1918, illustrated and invented assorted superheroes (including the Flash and his own, absurd Herbie Popnecker) in his 20s, and served in the Army during World War II. He found later happiness in his 1958 marriage, presumably inspiring the delirious, daftly satisfying romance comics of the early 1960s. Anne Whitney\u2019s death in 1970 precipitated his end: He died five years later in a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx. (Nadel also supplies this bit of dope: The \u201cWatchmen\u201d creator Alan Moore\u2019s 2016 novel \u201cJerusalem\u201d depicts Whitney meeting James Joyce\u2019s schizophrenic daughter, Lucia, in the asylum.)",

But he insisted his inspiration came from the gems in the Fifth Avenue windows of Van Cleef & Arpels, the Parisian jeweler run by Claude Arpels. Claude\u2019s uncle, Louis, had been the first Arpels to recognize the elegant symbiosis between gems and the ballet, commissioning the now 124-year-old maison\u2019s signature ballerina clips in the 1940s. Van Cleef & Arpels has continued to reference dance throughout its history, most recently with these earrings made in the dangling rounded-pendant balletti style, inspired by the jewel-toned ball gowns worn by women during the Italian Renaissance. While both pairs feature diamonds and pearls, one suggests spring, with a confection of rubies and pink sapphires, and the other gestures toward fall, with emeralds, yellow sapphires and black spinels. Both dance and spin weightlessly in the light, alive with effervescent grace. Price on request, vancleefarpels.com.",

To create the works, the 65-year-old artist provides written or illustrated instructions for viewers, inviting them to pose with wooden furniture, plastic buckets or ballpoint pens in unusual, sometimes physically strenuous, positions. The resulting contortions, which Wurm records in photographs, are at once humorous and discomforting: One sculpture comprises a performer pressing their forehead against a stack of three oranges; in another, a spectator is asked to plank their body atop a set of midcentury stools.",

Then there\u2019s the work of the York, England-based Matty Bovan, whose Hope and Fear collection featured unnerving sculptural forms \u2014 like oversize collars and inverted hoop skirts that alluded to dystopian courtiers \u2014 swathed in nostalgic Liberty fabrics that didn\u2019t so much conform to the body as they did create a protective shield sitting loosely around it.",

The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In \u201cEvery Drop of Blood,\u201d Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day.

It\u2019s also drought-resistant, nutritious, gluten-free and better for the soil than the commodity crops like corn, wheat, soy and rice that have become Africa\u2019s agricultural staples. Once fonio is winnowed and dried, the tiny grains (much smaller than quinoa) can be steamed and used in various ways. (Care must be taken so it doesn\u2019t clump and get gummy, and reheating can be tricky.) The book concentrates on traditional African dishes, with ingredients like cassava, okra, baobab leaf and red palm oil. But for wider appeal, like that of quinoa, it needs more recipes like his excellent roasted salmon with cheesy fonio grits. For me, fonio is more like polenta or cream of wheat than quinoa.

By 16, Sialelli was interning at Op\u00e9ra de Marseille\u2019s costume department, where he worked alongside members of the fashion designer Christian Lacroix\u2019s team. That apprenticeship led to another at Lacroix\u2019s headquarters in Paris, during which time Sialelli studied fashion at Studio Ber\u00e7ot. After graduating in 2010, he spent four years working on Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s and Alexander Wang\u2019s design teams at Balenciaga before moving to Acne Studios, Paco Rabanne and, finally, Loewe, where he led men\u2019s wear under the creative director Jonathan Anderson until late 2018. Last January, at 31 years old, Sialelli returned to Paris to become the head of the oldest continuously operating fashion house in France, founded by Jeanne Lanvin in 1889.",
