Gold and diamonds commingle with political unrest and poverty in \\u201cThe Kingmaker,\\u201d Lauren Greenfield\\u2019s documentary portrait of Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines. Through interviews \\u2014 including with Marcos, who speaks here at length \\u2014 and other footage, Greenfield (\\u201cThe Queen of Versailles\\u201d) examines Marcos\\u2019s time as first lady during the 1960s, \\u201970s and \\u201980s; her subsequent flight and exile; and her place in contemporary politics. The film ultimately \\u201cbecomes less about one woman, her malevolent charms and quirks, and develops into an unsettling look at imperial power,\\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. \\u201cGreenfield trots out the plunder and of course the shoes \\u2014 those notorious emblems of Marcos\\u2019s excess \\u2014 but also examines the appalling costs of that luxury,\\u201d Dargis wrote. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history.\\u201d\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"What\\u2019s on TV Friday: \\u2018The Kingmaker\\u2019 and \\u2018RuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race\\u2019\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-02-28T06:00:07+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"A senior Chinese official in Hong Kong on his government\\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"A senior Chinese official in Hong Kong on his government\\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"HONG KONG \\u2014 China is making headway in the battle against the Covid-19 epidemic.
