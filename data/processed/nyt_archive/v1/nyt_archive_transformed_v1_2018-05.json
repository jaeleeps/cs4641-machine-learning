THE GREAT NEW YORK SUBWAY MAP By Emiliano Ponzi. (Museum of Modern Art, $19.95.) We forget that such an everyday object like the New York City subway map was once actually a feat of graphic design. This illustrated book, intended for children but informative for all, reminds us of Massimo Vignelli\u2019s great innovation. THE WORLD-ENDING FIRE By Wendell Berry. (Counterpoint, $26.) Berry, the defender of rural American lands and communities, holds on fiercely to a dying way of life in this collection of essays. He rails against the mass-produced and tries to rally our appreciation for the natural world. TRIP By Tao Lin. (Vintage, paper, $16.) Lin, the provocateur, produces his first book-length work of nonfiction, an exploration of psychedelic drugs and the realizations they opened up for him. ROOTED COSMOPOLITANS By James Loeffler. (Yale, $32.50.) This year marks two 70th anniversaries: Israel\u2019s birth and the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Loeffler reminds us how entwined the two events were \u2014 both for the role Jews played in codifying human rights and for how Zionism was buoyed by these new international values.",

Plastic straws kill marine life and choke reefs and beaches, never decomposing completely, but instead breaking into bits of microplastics, which eventually enter the food chain.

Tammie Jo Shults of Southwest Airlines made her emergency landing of a Boeing 737 on April 17 after an engine explosion and traumatic injuries in the cabin, the world took note of the previous history she made as one of the first women to serve as a fighter pilot in the Navy. Shults, 56, who had wanted to fly since she was a teenager, first tried to enlist in the Air Force and was turned down. She was instead commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and served first as an instructor pilot for the T-2 Buckeye, a training aircraft for student aviators, and then flew as an A-7 Corsair pilot. When her squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet, then the Navy\u2019s newest fighter jet, Shults was one of the first women to pilot it. But because she was a woman, Shults was prevented from joining a combat squadron, and so she transferred to the Reserve in 1993. Shults then started working for Southwest Airlines as a commercial pilot. Two days after Shults left active duty, the Navy asked the Clinton administration to allow women to fly in combat assignments.",

The journey to St. Kilda has not been easy. First, there were three consecutive days of last-minute boat cancellations as I sat in Portree on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland, around 250 miles northwest of Edinburgh, waiting for favorable weather conditions. They arrive, as if by magic, on the very last day that I can conceivably remain on the island before heading back home to London. Without that last-minute salvation, I would have had to return next summer to get to St. Kilda, which is another (nearly) hundred miles farther west. And the phrase \u201cfavorable weather conditions\u201d here means something more obscure than the absence of driving rain. It depends on two things \u2014 \u201cwind speed,\u201d which is obvious enough once it\u2019s pointed out, and \u201csea swell,\u201d a surface state of water that dictates whether a boat can make landing at the bay in Hirta, the main island in the small archipelago of St. Kilda.

In 1972, Thomas Kuhn, the philosopher of science who invented the idea of \u201cparadigm shifts,\u201d threw an ashtray at Morris, then a graduate student. The two disagreed about the nature of truth and reality. This book is Morris\u2019s attempt to throw that ashtray back. THE MATHEMATICS OF THE BREATH AND THE WAY By Charles Bukowski. (City Lights, paper, $16.95.) The old, drunken lech offers his ideas about writing and the art of trying to live as a writer in a series of collected interviews and essays. THE BOOK OF WHY By Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie. (Basic Books, $32.) Pearl, winner of the 2011 Turing Award (as well as the father of Daniel Pearl), has focused his research on causality. How can we know whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet or if a specific drug cured an illness? This book breaks down his scientific theory. LIGHTING THE FIRES OF FREEDOM By Janet Dewart Bell. (The New Press, $25.99.) African-American women were central to the civil rights movement, but seldom get their due. Bell looks to move beyond Rosa Parks to show the fuller panoply by profiling nine largely forgotten women who were also on the front lines. WHEN EINSTEIN WALKED WITH G\u00d6DEL By Jim Holt. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) Does time exist? What is infinity? What is quantum physics?

(See Pete Wells\u2019s review this week of Soogil, in the East Village.) The Bari, in NoHo, blends Korean and Japanese influences. Its specialty is food in bowls (bari means bowl), with a separate section on the menu listing seven, including bluefin tuna poke, udon noodles, uni bibimbap and a rice and farro \u201crisotto.\u201d Other dishes include an avocado salad with snow crab, and gochujang ribs with miso. At the sushi bar, a $65 omakase includes more than a dozen pieces. The restaurant is the work of Danny Hahn, who has managed restaurants but never owned one before.

His car was just so: an old Mercedes in artichoke green. So was his outfit: a navy wool sweater and beige jeans \u2014 the kind of ostensibly low-key uniform that, in the creative professions, can serve to camouflage serious control-freakery. But when he pulled up to the towerlike townhouse and was asked why he had chosen it, he invoked the word \u201cmortgage\u201d rather than the nobility of its materials or the quality of its light. \u201cGetting a house in the countryside is a way to save money when you have these jobs that are so unreliable,\u201d he said.",

Strolling its streets, you catch glimpses of intimate spaces that exist just beyond the public facades: wisteria-draped courtyards, ivy-shrouded archways, begonias spilling from terraces. These hints of private realms beckon most alluringly from the Tiber River-adjacent Regola neighborhood, known since the Renaissance as the center for mercantile activities from plate-making to leather-stitching. It\u2019s here, in a space in the historic Palazzo Capponi Antonelli, a 16th-century building with a pebbled cortile and a stone fountain, that the boutique Chez D\u00e9d\u00e9 sells the best of contemporary Italian artisanry. In the ground-floor boutique, whose walls are hung with posters drawn by co-owner Andrea Ferolla, a 56-year-old fashion illustrator and creative director, items are arranged in inviting tableaus \u2014 a retail version of the ideal Roman home. The brand\u2019s own patterned canvas carryalls sit atop velvet-upholstered couches, and the living room\u2019s lampshades are sewn from vintage Arjumand\u2019s World wallpaper; the vanity\u2019s shelves are lined with Linda Rodin\u2019s perfume; and beyond that, there is a closet dedicated to robes, dresses and coats by the Italian line Giuliva Heritage Collection. \u201cI wanted to show how objects could inform each other,\u201d says co-owner Daria Reina, a 48-year-old photographer and creative director who, with Ferolla, opened the shop three years ago. (Like many respectable creative duos, the two had a scandalous affair before becoming a couple 16 years ago, back when Reina was freelancing at an agency where Ferolla was a creative director.)",

The project is part of Our/Vodka, which makes city-specific spirits (Amsterdam, Berlin, Detroit, London and Los Angeles are the others). All are small-batch distilleries that depend mostly on the local water for their whisper of differences. The New York vodka, 80-proof and served in drinks or sold by the bottle, was a tad fruity; the Los Angeles sample finished sweetly. A 100-proof version with a slightly richer mouthfeel is available only at the distillery. The bar also serves basic snacks: Our/New York, 80-proof, $22.99 for 375 milliliters, 151 West 26th Street (Seventh Avenue), 646-753-5556, ourvodka.com.",

The organic label can be slapped onto cartons of eggs laid by hens crowded in semiconfinement on megafarms, as well as on those from hens that scratch outdoors for dinner. The Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit agricultural watchdog group that reveals industrial practices within the elastic organic standards, began rating eggs over five years ago. The ratings, updated last year, are based on how the birds are raised. About 150 local and national brands are judged at one to five eggs, the highest mark. The organization does not have an app yet, but Mark Kastel, a founder, said the online chart is mobile friendly. Yogurt and other dairy products, pet foods and more have also been evaluated on the website: cornucopia.org.",
