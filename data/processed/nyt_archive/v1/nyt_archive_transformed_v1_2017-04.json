It was a text from a journalist he knew: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but you\u2019re on the death list.\u201d Kepel turned toward his TV, which was already on, and the top story eliminated any confusion. A French-born jihadi named Larossi Abballa had murdered a police officer and his wife in a town west of Paris and then delivered a macabre speech on Facebook Live \u2014 with the couple\u2019s 3-year-old child cowering nearby \u2014 in which he called for the killing of seven public figures. The French media omitted the details, but an Interior Ministry official soon called with confirmation: Kepel\u2019s name was near the top of the list. His initial feeling, he later told me, was \u201cas if the subject I\u2019ve been studying for 35 years had turned around to strike at me.\u201d Within hours, he had a government security team assigned to guard him 24 hours a day. A similar death warrant was issued against him later that summer, elevating the sense of danger.",

With a golden cover and 650-odd images inside, the volume is a sociological record of the extreme measures taken to acquire and spend money, what Greenfield calls \u201cthe influence of affluence.\u201d One shot shows Tupac at the craps table in Vegas, another, a Chinese billionaire\u2019s replica of the White House. Some of the photographs will go on view this weekend in a show of Greenfield\u2019s work at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, and are set to land in New York this fall, around the release of her next documentary. All of this output suggests a longstanding clarity of purpose, but Greenfield says it wasn\u2019t until the financial crisis of 2008 (which she calls \u201ca morality tale\u201d) that she realized the underlying theme uniting her work. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Birkin bags or the Kardashians,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the culture that gave rise to them.\u201d",

Later, during the Enlightenment, clockwork mechanisms left their imprint on materialist arguments that man was only a sophisticated machine. And as of 1990, it was concepts from computing that explained us to ourselves: \u201cToday\u2019s embrace of the computational metaphor in the cognitive and neural sciences is so widespread and automatic that it begins to appear less like an innovative leap than like a bandwagon phenomenon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is a tendency to rephrase every assertion about mind or brains in computational terms.\u201d",

It was once home of the Parade Bar, a watering hole known for its velvety red interiors, its Orientalist paintings depicting half-nude Nubians and its illustrious clientele. Among its regulars was one Jane Auer Bowles, an extravagant woman of elfin physique who, by the end of her days, had taken to wearing a conspicuous wig. To many of the locals, she was magnouna, the crazy one. At the Parade, where she drank herself into a stupor most nights, she was said to have stripped naked on more than one occasion. Few knew she was a writer. She was rumored to have published one novel, in her 20s, and to have never produced much of anything again.",

			"lead_paragraph": "It\u2019s gone now, replaced by a small, unobtrusive park, but in the middle of the 20th century the Stork Club, on East 53rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, was the center of an emerging national culture of celebrity. As Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of \u201ca person who is known for his well-knownness.\u201d And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fame\u2019s sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a m\u00e9lange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the club\u2019s Table 50. In Winchell\u2019s reporting, \u201cThe death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance,\u201d Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. \u201cDozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated.\u201d Winchell\u2019s reach was enormous. One listener recalled \u201cstrolling one Sabbath evening for six blocks through a residential section of Birmingham [Alabama] and never losing a word of W.W.\u2019s broadcast as his voice came through a succession of open windows.\u201d",

Lincoln was living in Harlem in 1962 when she helped to establish the Cultural Association for Women of African Heritage. Her 1966 essay \u201cWho Will Revere the Black Woman?\u201d has been reprinted in various collections over the years. But her music lives the fullest afterlife. Lincoln\u2019s tart drawl earned comparisons to Billie Holiday, but she matched it with a deep, bridling intensity that refused to be displaced. The sharp poetry of her lyrics conveyed only a sliver of her message. From Thursday, May 4 to 7, the Apollo Theater will host a festival of conversations and performances titled \u201cWomen of the World.\u201d It culminates on Saturday, May 6, with a concert celebrating Lincoln\u2019s work. The musical director, Terri Lyne Carrington, has assembled three world-class vocalists to honor Lincoln: Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Esperanza Spalding. (apollotheater.org)",

She was in some ways the least noticed of the group because she addressed the emperor\u2019s-clothes aspect of art through the least showy filter: She simply took photographs of objects in museums, auction houses and private collections, and revealed them to be the pricey bric-a-brac that they are. Built into her work was a view of art\u2019s fragility \u2014 and a sense of our own, which keeps us attached to it. But what does the market care? It\u2019s never been less fragile, and with this MoMA survey, which opens on Sunday, April 30, one of its most astute critics becomes one of the season\u2019s brightest stars.

Consider Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight,\u201d reviewed by Paul Krugman and new to the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. On its face, the book \u2014 subtitled \u201cThe Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class\u201d \u2014 is all about economic issues, and the index is correspondingly flecked with terms like \u201clayoffs\u201d (one citation), \u201cmanufacturing decline\u201d (one citation) and \u201crent assistance\u201d (two citations). But really these are just the parsley on the meatloaf. Flip through the back pages and it\u2019s clear that Warren, the hard-punching Massachusetts senator, has a more personal fight in mind: The index listing for \u201cTrump, Donald\u201d is divided into dozens of subcategories beginning with \u201cbait-and-switch and\u201d (two citations), then moving on to \u201cbigotry and\u201d (four citations), \u201ccorporate influences on\u201d (five citations) and \u201ctrickle-down and\u201d (seven citations).

When Comme des Gar\u00e7ons made its Paris Fashion Week debut in 1981, the clothes drew attention in their absolute absence of color \u2014 an impression that was underlined by interviews with Kawakubo, herself invariably dressed in blacks. Note the plural: Kawakubo used so much, it was possible to see shades and nuances of black in her collections. She wasn\u2019t the first to design in black, of course \u2014 Chanel transformed it from a color of mourning into a color of fashion in the 1920s, with her little black dresses, and designers had used it ever since. But by the 1980s, it had fallen out of favor with the rising preference for flashier colors \u2014 the brilliant pinks and greens of Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler \u2014 and the greiges and navies of Giorgio Armani. Black had never been used with Kawakubo\u2019s severity and insistence \u2014 she\u2019s used the word \u201cstrength\u201d to describe the color. But in 1988, Kawakubo seemed to abruptly change course: She showed a fall collection dominated by rich scarlet. The thought process behind the decision? \u201cRed is black,\u201d she said at the time. Kawakubo\u2019s challenge to color \u2014 and perhaps, as the French theorist Jean Baudrillard reasoned, to the idea of women sporting loud hues being transformed into \u2018objects\u2019 \u2014 is one of the most important fashion statements of the late 20th century. It transformed black into a color of fashion, intellectualism and rebellion \u2014 women who wore her clothes were dubbed \u201cthe crows.\u201d And when the Harvard School of Design gave Kawakubo an Excellence in Design Award in 2000, they stated that she \u201cinvented\u201d black.
