It was both a daunting and heady opportunity for Berlin to reinvent itself and start over. Artists and musicians moved into abandoned breweries, warehouses and basements and slowly brought new life to neighborhoods like Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, which in turn attracted people from around the world. But now, thanks to rising rents, Berlin\\u2019s gentrified areas have become too expensive for many of its creative residents, and people have begun to move to farther-flung corners of the city. Three such neighborhoods are the historically industrial areas of Treptow-K\\u00f6penick, Rummelsburg and Obersch\\u00f6neweide, 10 or so miles southeast of the city center, where some of Berlin\\u2019s most pioneering artists now occupy a string of former industrial buildings along the Spree River. It is in Obersch\\u00f6neweide, too, that the Berlin gallerist Johann K\\u00f6nig, who represents several artists who have moved their studios to the area, is currently negotiating to take over and revive an old cable factory that will host artist studios and residencies. Although the area\\u2019s landscape may look post-apocalyptic, with its giant weeds and empty power plants, strangely, the future here can seem positively Arcadian: Real estate is still cheap enough that artists are able to buy, rather than rent, their spaces.

Dylan accepted the painting \\u2014 but was then faced with the problem of maneuvering the nearly seven-foot-long canvas into his station wagon. Finally, he tied it to the roof with the help of his friend, the filmmaker Barbara Rubin. Later, when the artist asked Dylan about the painting, the musician admitted that he\\u2019d given it to his manager. \\u201cBut if you gave me another one, Andy, I wouldn\\u2019t make that mistake again,\\u201d Dylan reportedly said.

But while the city\\u2019s food and wine scenes continue to flourish, its hotel options have remained limited. The opening of Dorp, a new hotel in the historic Bo-Kaap neighborhood in the city center, known for its colorful Cape Dutch and Georgian style houses, is set to change that. Conceived by the hotelier and clothing designer Gail Behr, who opened the plush old-world Grand Hotel in the South African seaside town of Plettenberg Bay in 2004, the intimate 30-room property is more of a club than a traditional hotel. \\u201cIt\\u2019s old-fashioned without being cloyingly personal and intrusive,\\u201d Behr says. Constructed from scratch with the help of the local designer Gregory Mellor, the building was devised to fit antique wooden doors, windows and slatted shutters that the team sourced from as far as India and Egypt. The interior \\u2014 filled with oversize printed couches, antique cabinets, old books, wood-burning fireplaces and claw-foot bathtubs \\u2014 was decorated by Behr herself. \\u201cI was determined not to take the design too seriously,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThe surrounding mountains cannot be competed with!\\u201d Indeed, located on the gently sloping base of Signal Hill, Dorp has astonishing views of Table Mountain and the city\\u2019s twinkling lights. One of the best places to enjoy the vista is the hotel\\u2019s rambling garden, created by the Cape Town-based landscape designer Leon Kluge and planted with ancient mission olive trees, gnarled guava trees and purple poppies. \\u201cThe garden is the prettiest place on earth, with millions of butterflies, dwarf Cape chameleons, birds and bees,\\u201d Behr says. A light-filled cafe on the ground floor serves unfussy dishes like homemade scones, grilled cheese sandwiches and slow-roasted local lamb. But perhaps Behr\\u2019s favorite space is the salon, a great homey living room brimming with couches covered in pink velvet and a playful dinosaur-printed toile by the British interiors brand House of Hackney, where she encourages guests to mingle. Already, she says, it is \\u201cfilled with interesting people collaborating \\u2014 and playing a poker game at the same time.\\u201d dorp.co.za \\u2014 MARY HOLLAND\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"T Suggests: Animal-Shaped Jewels, a Hotel With a View and More\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-10-18T21:09:41+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"A Times reporter says it is time to hold him accountable for his errant N.B.A. takes.
