He\u2019s traveling on a spaceship as part of a small criminal crew, bound for a black hole in deep space. Also on the ship is a troubled doctor played by Juliette Binoche; other crew members are played by Lars Eidinger and the musician Andr\u00e9 Benjamin. Their mission is derailed, in part, by an unexpected birth. \u201cAs is often the case in Denis\u2019s movies, \u2018High Life\u2019 vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous,\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201ctoo often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard \u2014 outer and inner space, Pattinson\u2019s head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then \u2014 more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision.\u201d",

			"lead_paragraph": "School is back in session, which for some people means packing lunchboxes and anguishing over outfits in the morning dark, and for other people means muttering about the bus traffic snarling Main Street on the way to the gym. For us, though, back-to-school time is just one more reason to celebrate good books. This week, that includes books about school: Robert Pondiscio\u2019s \u201cHow the Other Half Learns,\u201d about a year in the life of the impressive but polarizing charter school network Success Academy, and Paul Tough\u2019s \u201cThe Years That Matter Most,\u201d looking at college through the lens of a class system that reinforces its own rigid hierarchy. There\u2019s also Samantha Power\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe Education of an Idealist,\u201d which is less about school than about Power\u2019s on-the-job evolution as President Obama\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Two books this week tackle prejudice head-on \u2014 Ibram X. Kendi\u2019s \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist\u201d and Bari Weiss\u2019s \u201cHow to Fight Anti-Semitism\u201d \u2014 while Corey Robin\u2019s \u201cThe Enigma of Clarence Thomas\u201d upends some conventional wisdom about the Supreme Court justice. Finally, in fiction, we recommend new novels from some old favorites: Ann Patchett, Jacqueline Woodson and the British master Andrew Miller. Don\u2019t think of them as required reading \u2014 nobody likes a syllabus \u2014 but maybe sneak one of them inside your calculus textbook and enjoy.",

Still, he continues to make much of his work outside its bounds. While he produces most of his preparatory drawings in Berlin, his primary site of creation has remained in Westbury, a suburb of Johannesburg. There, using the plastered concrete wall of a vacant building as his canvas, he makes fleeting paintings (a shoal of small geometric shapes for the 2012 series \u201cSchool of Fish,\u201d a spiral staircase for the 2017 work \u201cPrinciple of Hope\u201d), and invites a performer wearing a mask \u2014 oftentimes the dancer Kevin Narain, a collaborator of eight years \u2014 to interact with the work, contorting his body to echo its shapes. He captures the dancer\u2019s actions in a sequence of photographs and then scrubs the wall clean in less than 24 hours (although he leaves the vacant building as he found it, he also gives its owner a bottle of whiskey whenever he\u2019s in town). For Rhode, the ephemerality of the movements and the reactionary nature of graffiti art underline the overlooked poverty and injustice permeating urban slums in cities; often he will work with more than a dozen local collaborators on a single piece. \u201cMy community are my studio assistants,\u201d he says.",

In the midst of this activity, American and British operatives planned to dig a tunnel underneath the city, to intercept communications headed to and from Moscow. In \u201cBetrayal in Berlin,\u201d Steve Vogel, a former longtime reporter for The Washington Post, tells the story of the tunnel\u2019s creation. He also delves into the life of George Blake, a British spy who became a double agent for the Soviets, reporting to them about, among other things, the progress of the tunnel project. Born in the Netherlands, Blake lived an outsize life of both great bravery and great deception. Below, Vogel talks about being inspired by his father\u2019s work for the C.I.A., the similarities between spies and journalists, and tracking down Blake for an interview.",

			"lead_paragraph": "Thirty years ago, when the Berlin Wall came down, the city was left with huge swaths of empty buildings in the former East: old German Democratic Republic embassies and factory complexes, some still riddled with toxic waste. It was both a daunting and heady opportunity for Berlin to reinvent itself and start over. Artists and musicians moved into abandoned breweries, warehouses and basements and slowly brought new life to neighborhoods like Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, which in turn attracted people from around the world. But now, thanks to rising rents, Berlin\u2019s gentrified areas have become too expensive for many of its creative residents, and people have begun to move to farther-flung corners of the city. Three such neighborhoods are the historically industrial areas of Treptow-K\u00f6penick, Rummelsburg and Obersch\u00f6neweide, 10 or so miles southeast of the city center, where some of Berlin\u2019s most pioneering artists now occupy a string of former industrial buildings along the Spree River. It is in Obersch\u00f6neweide, too, that the Berlin gallerist Johann K\u00f6nig, who represents several artists who have moved their studios to the area, is currently negotiating to take over and revive an old cable factory that will host artist studios and residencies. Although the area\u2019s landscape may look post-apocalyptic, with its giant weeds and empty power plants, strangely, the future here can seem positively Arcadian: Real estate is still cheap enough that artists are able to buy, rather than rent, their spaces. Here, four artists discuss how their work is shaped by the Spree.",

Star-struck by his subject, Warhol offered Dylan a painting: a 1963 silk-screened portrait of Elvis Presley, of whom Dylan once said, \u201cHearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail.\u201d (The portrait, ironically, is taken from a publicity still of Elvis from the Western film \u201cFlaming Star,\u201d in which he looks very sheriff-like.) Dylan accepted the painting \u2014 but was then faced with the problem of maneuvering the nearly seven-foot-long canvas into his station wagon. Finally, he tied it to the roof with the help of his friend, the filmmaker Barbara Rubin. Later, when the artist asked Dylan about the painting, the musician admitted that he\u2019d given it to his manager. \u201cBut if you gave me another one, Andy, I wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again,\u201d Dylan reportedly said. Only later did Warhol find out that Dylan had traded the canvas for a sofa. The painting now hangs in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. The last so-called \u201cFerus Type\u201d Elvis to appear at auction \u2014 Warhol made 23 of them in total \u2014 was sold at Christie\u2019s for $53 million in May.

The executive chef, John Schafer, has created a menu that\u2019s more American and somewhat meatier than the one he offers at Tessa, which skews Mediterranean. Pigs in a blanket, roasted bone marrow, clams in white wine, and a grain bowl are some of the appetizers. There are a few pastas, and main dishes include Berkshire pork tenderloin, king salmon with corn pudding, sea scallops with whipped celery root and asparagus, and a burger. Some meat and seafood selections can be ordered grilled simply. \u201cLots of our customers want no sauces and no vegetables, so we decided to serve some items like that,\u201d Mr. Bellone said. ",

Sex, darkness and a dash of the supernatural are added to the Nancy Drew formula here, in a series that reimagines that classic young sleuth for a contemporary audience. The hourlong drama raises Drew\u2019s age to 18, and it relocates the action to Maine. The show also gives Drew (played by Kennedy McMann) a tough back story: In this show, she has a strained relationship with her father, and her mother has recently died. There are also ghosts, an element that factors into the show\u2019s first major case, which involves the murder of a socialite. \u201cAt the core is the idea of a young woman who believes in righting wrongs and finding the truth,\u201d Stephanie Savage, a creator of the series, said in a recent interview with The New York Times.",

But a lesser-known, more local handle \u2014 Smallwaukee \u2014 may best capture the personality of this Wisconsin city of 600,000, which can feel like a small town in big-city clothing, embodying the advantages of both. The fortunes of the Bucks and Brewers are followed in unpretentious taverns that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place on a rural crossroads, and traditional meat-and-potato eateries are as patronized as the latest farm-to-table restaurant. The sleek new Hop streetcar line can take you to the Milwaukee Public Market, with its array of local foodstuffs, or within walking distance of the Santiago Calatrava-designed Milwaukee Art Museum, one of the most beautiful repositories of art in the world. Smallwaukee will grow very large indeed next July when the Democratic National Convention descends upon the city, with downtown\u2019s new Fiserv Forum as its epicenter. The convention\u2019s choice is sneakily apt. Terms like progressivism and democratic socialism, which add crackle and spark to today\u2019s national political conversation, are not academic concepts here. The city elected Socialist mayors for 38 of the last century\u2019s 100 years, and sent the first Socialist, Victor Berger, to the House of Representatives in 1910. And, rest assured, they were the kind of politicians you could have a beer with.",

Less common, though, is the layout of the couple\u2019s building; to reach the home of Gohar, a Cairo-born artist, and Sosa, a Barcelona-born graphic designer and publisher who co-founded the interiors magazine Apartamento, you must first enter a former tenement built in the mid-19th century on a now-bustling stretch of Spring Street, just west of the Bowery, then walk down a narrow, dimly lit hallway that opens into a 400-square-foot courtyard densely planted with laurel and vivid green birch trees. At the opposite end, down a leaf-strewn brick path, you\u2019ll find a four-story red brick structure. Dating to that same period, it is one of New York\u2019s so-called backhouses, the smaller residences that landlords erected in the 19th century behind the cover of larger buildings to increase rent revenue. Despite its origins, the building, which now has five units, is calm and oasis-like. At once hemmed in and bucolic, it evokes the dwelling in Virginia Lee Burton\u2019s 1942 children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Little House,\u201d the looming metropolis pressed up against it.",

At Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, the exhibition \u201cYou\u2019re at Home\u201d brings together his digitally animated video series \u201cBirds in Paradise\u201d (2017-19), in which folkloric motifs and symbols of American consumerism tumble into a video-game world, and his 3D-printed objects, such as coin purses and jewelry boxes, based on drawings made by his mother, Patricia Satterwhite, before her death in 2016. Meanwhile, at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, the show \u201cRoom for Living\u201d features a group of works Satterwhite developed during his recently completed two-year residency at the museum. They include figurative sculptures inspired by virtual objects from his video series \u201cReifying Desire\u201d (2011-14), in which Satterwhite\u2019s own digitally animated avatar navigates a world where his mother\u2019s renderings of household items are realized. The residency has been a homecoming of sorts for the artist, who obtained his M.F.A. in the city in 2010 before moving to New York, where he broke through with his virtual and live-action performances at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the 2014 Whitney Biennial.",

These are some of the many accouterments of wealth seen in this latest feature from Steven Soderbergh. Adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Jake Bernstein, the film tells a collection of stories related to the Panama Papers. At its center are Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman, who play seedy partners in a Panama City-based law firm that helps the very rich stay wealthy through many flavors of trickery. The pair\u2019s most prominent victim here is Ellen Martin, a Midwestern widow played by Meryl Streep who catches on to the firm\u2019s dishonesty when she tries to settle an insurance claim after her husband\u2019s death. Also in the cast: Sharon Stone, Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts. \u201cThe film\u2019s subject matter could hardly be more urgent,\u201d A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.

			"lead_paragraph": "Cape Town, in the shadow of Table Mountain on the South African coast, has become one of the most buzzed about travel destinations in Africa in recent years. But while the city\u2019s food and wine scenes continue to flourish, its hotel options have remained limited. The opening of Dorp, a new hotel in the historic Bo-Kaap neighborhood in the city center, known for its colorful Cape Dutch and Georgian style houses, is set to change that. Conceived by the hotelier and clothing designer Gail Behr, who opened the plush old-world Grand Hotel in the South African seaside town of Plettenberg Bay in 2004, the intimate 30-room property is more of a club than a traditional hotel. \u201cIt\u2019s old-fashioned without being cloyingly personal and intrusive,\u201d Behr says. Constructed from scratch with the help of the local designer Gregory Mellor, the building was devised to fit antique wooden doors, windows and slatted shutters that the team sourced from as far as India and Egypt. The interior \u2014 filled with oversize printed couches, antique cabinets, old books, wood-burning fireplaces and claw-foot bathtubs \u2014 was decorated by Behr herself. \u201cI was determined not to take the design too seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cThe surrounding mountains cannot be competed with!\u201d Indeed, located on the gently sloping base of Signal Hill, Dorp has astonishing views of Table Mountain and the city\u2019s twinkling lights. One of the best places to enjoy the vista is the hotel\u2019s rambling garden, created by the Cape Town-based landscape designer Leon Kluge and planted with ancient mission olive trees, gnarled guava trees and purple poppies. \u201cThe garden is the prettiest place on earth, with millions of butterflies, dwarf Cape chameleons, birds and bees,\u201d Behr says. A light-filled cafe on the ground floor serves unfussy dishes like homemade scones, grilled cheese sandwiches and slow-roasted local lamb. But perhaps Behr\u2019s favorite space is the salon, a great homey living room brimming with couches covered in pink velvet and a playful dinosaur-printed toile by the British interiors brand House of Hackney, where she encourages guests to mingle. Already, she says, it is \u201cfilled with interesting people collaborating \u2014 and playing a poker game at the same time.\u201d dorp.co.za \u2014 MARY HOLLAND",

In looking back at that comic for The New York Times, Adam Sternbergh wrote that \u201cWatchmen\u201d \u201cfelt entirely new, given it meant considering heroes as fallible and complex humans, prone to the array of ugly and shameful emotions recognizable from the real world.\u201d Now, with superhero stories dominating the box office, this new series from the \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d creator Damon Lindelof offers a new take on that comic, trading the original\u2019s Cold War themes for those of white supremacy. Regina King stars as Angela Abar, who works with the police as her masked alter ego, Sister Night, while Jeremy Irons and Jean Smart play older versions of original \u201cWatchmen\u201d characters Adrian Veidt and Laurie Juspeczyk.

For three seasons the series has shown how changes in the pornography industry in the United States affected the people involved in it. The show\u2019s final season, which concludes Monday, jumped  to the mid-1980s, when VHS technology made it possible for people to watch erotic films easily at home. Some of the show\u2019s characters, like Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who went from prostitute to pornographic film director, seem to have prospered amid these changes, while others, like Frankie (James Franco),  have clearly suffered. But for the most part the message is clear: Everyone is trying to get by in a world controlled by forces stronger than any individual. ",

It follows his childhood as a socially awkward, bullied boy with a stressful home life, which fuels his rage, leading him to enact his first murderous rampage on Halloween night at just 10 years old. He\u2019s then locked away in a mental institution and breaks out 15 years later in an attempt to reconnect with his younger sister, who\u2019s now a teenager.

My children were both in school \u2014 I\u2019d quit my job to raise a family \u2014 and I was lost, insecure, unhappy in my marriage and deeply depressed. (I was later put on antidepressants, which I continue to take to this day.) Not only did this woman think I was special and build my ego up as no one had ever done, but she also thought my writing was amazing. She had impressive credentials (she was published; she was enrolled as a graduate student in another program at the university and so on) so her support and encouragement made me feel as though I could accomplish anything.
