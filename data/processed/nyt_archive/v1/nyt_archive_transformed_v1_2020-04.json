At the outset of Season 3, which is debuting two weeks earlier than planned, we learn that Eve survived the shooting but is utterly broken. She takes a job at a Korean restaurant, seemingly wiping her hands clean of Eve, MI6 and The Twelve. Villanelle has a  new love, but is clearly hung up on Eve. And in a change of pace, the show is peeling back the layers of her past, introducing us to her former Russian trainer (Harriet Walter) and revealing the traumas that left her coldhearted and alone.

There are few subjects as rich in storytelling potential as parent-child conflict and law enforcement. This series, which wraps its first season tonight, includes a lot of both. It follows Malcolm Bright (Tom Payne), an N.Y.P.D. investigator who is trying to evade the legacy of his serial killer father, Martin Whitly (Michael Sheen). His attempts to distance himself from his paternal inheritance were stymied when a copycat case required him to turn to Martin for help. Last week\\u2019s episode ended with Malcolm being arrested and charged with an offscreen murder. In the finale, perhaps we\\u2019ll see if he has followed in his father\\u2019s bloody footsteps.\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"What\\u2019s on TV Monday: \\u2018Breeders\\u2019 and \\u2018Never Have I Ever\\u2019\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-04-27T05:00:06+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"This word has appeared in two articles on NYTimes.com in the past year.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"This word has appeared in two articles on NYTimes.com in the past year.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"_________\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"Word + Quiz: badinage\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2020-04-27T06:00:01+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"Men are more likely than women to die of the coronavirus, so scientists are treating them with something women have more of: female sex hormones.\",\n      \"snippet\": \"Men are more likely than women to die of the coronavirus, so scientists are treating them with something women have more of: female sex hormones.\",\n      \"lead_paragraph\": \"As the novel coronavirus swept through communities around the world, preying disproportionately on the poor and the vulnerable, one disadvantaged group has demonstrated a remarkable resistance.
