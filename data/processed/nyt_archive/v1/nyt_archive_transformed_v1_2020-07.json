He is often considered the founder of minimalist music, having stripped composition down to its bare elements of rhythm, sound and tempo as early as the late \\u201950s. His compositions can alternate between abrasive (the 30-minute-long \\u201cDay of Niagara,\\u201d recorded in 1965 with Zazeela, along with Cale and sometime Velvet Underground collaborators Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise, is a loud score that sounds not unlike an airplane engine and predated the noise rock of Reed\\u2019s \\u201cMetal Machine Music\\u201d and other staples of early punk by about a decade) and hauntingly beautiful (such as 1958\\u2019s \\u201cTrio for Strings,\\u201d a three-hour piece that effectively created the language of minimalist music through the use of sustained tones punctuated by brief gasps of silence).
