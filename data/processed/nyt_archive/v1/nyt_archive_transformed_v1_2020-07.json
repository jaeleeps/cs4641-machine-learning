Now, imagine doing that with the actual famous person also onstage. That was the tall order given to Christine Lahti, who plays Gloria Steinem in this biographical play. Written by Emily Mann and directed by Diane Paulus, \u201cGloria: A Life\u201d follows a familiar biographical formula in its first portion, which stages many steps of Steinem\u2019s career \u2014 including her involvement with the women\u2019s movement and in the creation of Ms. magazine. But in the show\u2019s second part, Steinem herself steps onstage, and moderates a discussion with audience members about what they\u2019ve just seen. Both parts are in this recording of the play, which was shot during a live performance. In his review for The New York Times, Jesse Green wrote that the play \u201cwould make a useful introduction to the feminist trailblazer for those who know little about her remarkable overlapping careers as a journalist, activist and \u2018wandering organizer\u2019 for the revolution.\u201d But he added that it \u201cdoes not have much new to add\u201d for audiences familiar with Steinem\u2019s story.",

Lovers of French cinema will delight in this new drama by the writer and filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda (\u201cShoplifters\u201d). Catherine Deneuve plays Fabienne, an acclaimed French movie star who publishes a memoir titled \u201cThe Truth.\u201d To celebrate its release, Fabienne\u2019s daughter Lumir (Juliette Binoche), a screenwriter, visits from New York with her husband (Ethan Hawke) and their young daughter. What ensues is a thoughtful, comedic portrait of mother-daughter dynamics. Fabienne is wrapped up in her own image and is in denial over her fading legacy, while Lumir claims her mother\u2019s confessional book is riddled with lies. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis named the movie a Critic\u2019s Pick and wrote, \u201cThe drama is measured out in sips, in gazes, gestures, silences, off-handed humor and shocks of brutality.\u201d",

That image, now in the Guggenheim\u2019s permanent collection, nods to the queer B.D.S.M. scene in which Opie found community in the \u201990s, while capturing the painful longing she felt for a family of her own. Queer domesticity was a radical thing to envision at the time, but three decades later, the pandemic has confined Opie to the Los Angeles home she now shares with her wife, Julie Burleigh, and their 18-year-old son, Oliver. Their daughter, Sara, whom Julie had when she was young, and their 6-year-old grandson, Joaquin, visit often, though for the first few months of quarantine, even that was off-limits. The house has art scattered across the mantles and climbing up to the high ceilings, some of it from famous friends, and some, like the children\u2019s drawings on the fridge, simply a reminder that once it arrives, family grows as unwieldy and resilient as the 90-year-old Aleppo pine tree in the yard.",

At one point she thought she might study economics or become a veterinarian, but her friends loved her creations and kept requesting versions for themselves. After studying fashion design at Paris\u2019s Studio Ber\u00e7ot, Marant launched Twen, a knitwear and jersey line, with her mother in 1989. \u201cI was determined to work for myself,\u201d she says. Her eponymous label debuted five years later, with a collection of men\u2019s-wear-inspired overcoats and striped suits that drew from Indonesian batiks and ikats. Her credo was simple: She\u2019d only design pieces she herself would wear. \u201cTo this day,\u201d says Marant, 53, \u201cnothing leaves the workshop without me trying it on.\u201d",

			"lead_paragraph": "THE COMPOSER LA MONTE YOUNG held his 84th birthday party on a drab, rainy Sunday afternoon last October inside the Church Street building where he has lived with his wife, the 80-year-old artist Marian Zazeela, since 1963. That people like Young and Zazeela can still be found in TriBeCa in 2020 is nothing short of remarkable. Young is certainly the lone musician alive today who can claim to be no more than two degrees removed from three of the greatest icons of 20th-century modern music: Igor Stravinsky (who taught Robert Stevenson, the musicologist who was Young\u2019s mentor in college), Charlie Parker (who played with the saxophonist Lee Konitz, with whom Young himself played as a session musician in Los Angeles) and Lou Reed (who co-founded the Velvet Underground with one of Young\u2019s bandmates, John Cale). He is often considered the founder of minimalist music, having stripped composition down to its bare elements of rhythm, sound and tempo as early as the late \u201950s. His compositions can alternate between abrasive (the 30-minute-long \u201cDay of Niagara,\u201d recorded in 1965 with Zazeela, along with Cale and sometime Velvet Underground collaborators Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise, is a loud score that sounds not unlike an airplane engine and predated the noise rock of Reed\u2019s \u201cMetal Machine Music\u201d and other staples of early punk by about a decade) and hauntingly beautiful (such as 1958\u2019s \u201cTrio for Strings,\u201d a three-hour piece that effectively created the language of minimalist music through the use of sustained tones punctuated by brief gasps of silence). In the 1960s, he introduced generations of musicians to the concepts of drones and sustained repetition and began incorporating Indian classical music into his work, about five years before George Harrison had ever heard of the sitar.",

But according to some critics of the show, its conservationist message was drowned out by the drama. This special, however, focuses on the stories of some of the animals who were transferred from G.W. Zoo, the Oklahoma wildlife park formerly owned by Joseph Maldonado-Passage, a.k.a. Joe Exotic. Among them are two visually impaired tigers whose vision is restored at the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Indiana, and two lions who are relocated to the WildCat Ridge Sanctuary in Oregon. The special also includes interviews with former G.W. Zoo employees, as well as footage that Maldonado-Passage filmed in 2018 as part of Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cWolves and Warriors\u201d show, before he was arrested.",

Encouraged by books, I\u2019d always been the type of Gothic amateur naturalist who preserved interesting bits of the dead. I cleaned and polished fox skulls; disarticulated, dried and kept the wings of roadkill birds. But I knew, looking at the swift, that I could not do anything like that to it. The bird was suffused with a kind of seriousness very akin to holiness. I didn\u2019t want to leave it there, so I took it home, swaddled it in a towel and tucked it in the freezer. It was in early May the next year, as soon as I saw the first returning swifts flowing down from the clouds, that I knew what I had to do.
