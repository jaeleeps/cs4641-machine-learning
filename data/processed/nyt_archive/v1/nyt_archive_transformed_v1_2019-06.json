Maybe they\\u2019ll blow off steam with a game of baseball afterward. After all, each night of the first presidential debates of the 2020 Democratic primary race carry nine candidates, enough to fill a team. The highest-polling candidate appearing Wednesday, the first night, is Senator Elizabeth Warren. Her opponents in the debate, held in Miami, will include Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Representative Beto O\\u2019Rourke of Texas; and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. The second debate will air Thursday, also at 9 p.m., on the same networks. It has perhaps the more starry showdown, with a pool that includes former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Three female candidates will appear each night, more than have ever before been on the debate stage at once (the third on Wednesday is Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii).\",\n      \"source\": \"The New York Times\",\n      \"headline_main\": \"What\\u2019s on TV Wednesday: A Democratic Debate and \\u2018Hamlet\\u2019\",\n      \"pub_date\": \"2019-06-26T05:00:06+0000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"The president\\u2019s response to E.
