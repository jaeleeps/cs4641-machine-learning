His parents organized family trips to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where the young art aficionado teared up the first time he saw a room full of pieces by Alexander Calder. Now 24, Baldwin will debut his first ready-to-wear collection during New York fashion week, inspired by his memories of these expeditions. \u201cSpring 2019 is from the perspective of myself as a child, dreaming after an art museum visit,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cThe collection seeks to replicate that childhood experience of first encountering the color field paintings of Brice Marden and Ellsworth Kelly.\u201d Baldwin originally studied sculpture at the Cleveland Institute of Art and landed an apprenticeship in 2013 with the milliner Marta Glazen. \u201cI became interested in headwear as a form of intimate sculpture on the body,\u201d he says. When he moved to New York City in 2015, he made custom headwear on his own for clients such as Lady Gaga, MAC and Barneys New York, and later for fashion brands such as Adam Selman and Polo Ralph Lauren. Making so many hats for so many labels, Baldwin wanted to finally create a brand under his vision. This coming collection, his first foray into ready-to-wear, will include a moir\u00e9 evening vest based on a small drawing by Ellsworth Kelly, a silk organza trench coat and, of course, beautiful headwear to top it all off.

The new collection, which launches this weekend, retains the minimalist \u201990s sensibility of the original line but features an updated fabric. Anoraks, padded jackets, quilted pants and bucket hats (there are also angular wraparound sunglasses) all come in a more technical, waterproof and windproof nylon, in a rainbow of new colors including highlighter pink, safety orange and bright mint green.

Behind a commercial strip lined with big-box stores, among the split-levels and center-hall colonials, in the kind of neighborhood where kids run through sprinklers on summer weekends, crouches a massive mushroom-cap dome, 48 feet in diameter. Formed by bright red Quonset hut ribs and flanked by two smaller partial domes, the structure \u2014 whose windowless front is done in inky coal masonry studded with rough-hewn chunks of aquamarine glass \u2014 looks like a spaceship that\u2019s pulled up its jet bridge. From the back, where its red exoskeleton is exposed, it resembles a birdcage. This is the Ford House, designed in 1947 by Bruce Goff, a prolific and startlingly original midcentury architect who remains, outside of design circles, largely unknown.",

Located in the entry hall, the loom had been built of oak and chestnut by a local carpenter, and its squared edges had long ago gone smooth to the touch. Susanna, who is now 86, would sit before it, raising alternate strings attached to bamboo poles by pressing on the wooden pedals at her feet. She would send a bobbin of weft thread gliding across the horizontal surface of the remaining strings, strung taut in the loom\u2019s belly, before yanking a heavy hinged wood batten with metal teeth toward herself, locking each new row into the others. This simple gesture \u2014 passing a weft thread through a base of stable warp threads \u2014 is the same for every piece of cloth ever woven. And on this loom, Susanna made everything the family needed, from bedcovers, blankets and towels to the wool textiles laid atop wood chests and the saddlebags slung over the backs of donkeys or men to transport things.

For decades, the city center has felt a bit abandoned and sometimes seedy as well-heeled locals gravitated toward modern suburbs like Escaz\u00fa and Santa Ana, home to American-style malls and restaurant chains. But lately, expatriates and Costa Ricans have returned home after years abroad, infusing fresh life into neglected 19th-century buildings and old houses in the city center. These recent arrivals have opened creative businesses, including design shops and hostels with co-working spaces, turning a few adjoining neighborhoods east of the Parque Central into the city\u2019s premier cultural and restaurant zone.",

At a time when baggy tailoring was the prevailing aesthetic in men\u2019s wear, a relative newcomer made a case for a precisely crafted razor-slim silhouette. The Times\u2019s fashion critic at the time, Cathy Horyn, singled it out as \u201cthe most anticipated show of the fall 2001 men\u2019s season.\u201d Tomorrow, some 17 years later, Slimane will make another buzzy debut, unveiling his first collection for Celine as the French brand\u2019s artistic, creative and image director, a role created specifically for him. Since his arrival at Celine in January \u2014 where he took over from Phoebe Philo, who announced her departure last year \u2014 Slimane has been remaking the house in his own image. When the brand introduces men\u2019s wear for the first time this season, with couture to follow next January, Slimane will showcase not only his sprawling powers of imagination but also what he is capable of when starting from a blank slate.",

			"lead_paragraph": "\u201cHe can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys,\u201d one critic wrote of Oscar Wilde in The Scots Observer in July 1890, responding to the first serialization of \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d in Lippincott\u2019s Magazine. This was just one of \u201chundreds of entries of vituperation in the press when it came out,\u201d Wilde\u2019s grandson Merlin Holland recently told The Times, and Wilde spent the next year revising his aestheticist tale of a double life for publication in book form, removing certain homoerotic passages. A new book of Wilde\u2019s handwritten manuscripts, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (SP Books, $250), grants readers unfiltered access to lines of pure, unadulterated affection that the author was compelled to omit if he ever wanted the story to become the literary success it did. \u201cIt is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance than a man should ever give to a friend,\u201d the painter Basil tells Dorian in the magazine edition, but not the final novel. \u201cSomehow I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. \u2026 I quite admit that I adore you madly, extravagantly, absurdly.\u201d Such sentences led Lippincott\u2019s readers to deem this, in Holland\u2019s words, \u201ca disgusting, sodomitical novel.\u201d (He added that the full text would later be used in court as \u201ccircumstantial proof that Wilde was homosexual\u201d \u2014 a charge that sent him to prison.) Holland, who wrote the new book\u2019s foreword, considers this \u201cthe urtext of \u2018Dorian Gray,\u2019\u201d revealing raw passions the writer intended to evoke before the world was yet ready to read them. \u201cHe was standing up for his right as an artist to write about whatever he pleased,\u201d Holland said of his grandfather. \u201cHe had the right to create the characters he wanted to create.\u201d",
