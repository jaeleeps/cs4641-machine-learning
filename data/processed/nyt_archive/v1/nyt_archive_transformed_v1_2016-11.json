He also had a camera and the best studio he could ask for: a roomy old Checker cab that was his from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. on weekends, when traffic thinned and tips were not always something he could count on. Turning the camera on his fares was a way to displace his rage at the inequities that come with a taxi, where the customer holds all the power and the driver does all the work. Sometimes he snapped people at the beginning of a ride, sometimes after he reached their destination. He mounted a strobe light onto the cab\u2019s sun visor using rubber bands. He wasn\u2019t fancy.

Some seats face the kitchen, though with a no-reservations policy, snaring one may be a challenge. The food, made fresh, is basically Asian, highlighting ramen but also offering soba noodle dishes, donburi rice bowls and curries, which the executive chef of the group, Steve Mangleshot, thinks will have special appeal for New Yorkers.

The Crying Jordan meme was all over my social-media feeds, and although I had drifted from my Tar Heels-obsessed childhood, I felt unusually bummed out.

After the game, Paige choked up at the news conference and Carolina\u2019s fan base let out a long sigh for a player it had cheered on for four years.

As Bill Bryson writes in his introduction to THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING 2016 (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $14.95), which highlights two dozen locations across the globe, travel is \u201cenriching, stimulating, seductive, pleasurable \u2014 but very often a touch compulsive, too.\u201d For an example of all these qualities, consult Gretel Ehrlich\u2019s ravishing, troubling essay about her perilous journeys by dog sled on the melting ice floes off Greenland\u2019s coast. (\u201cWhen I asked if we were going to die, he smiled and said, \u2018Imaqa.\u2019 Maybe.\u201d) Yet some travelers do seem to have reined in their wanderlust, alert to geopolitical flux. Five years ago, I learned the prudence of such caution when friends emailed me in alarm from Damascus, where they had been lured by an article I\u2019d written about the city\u2019s beguiling old-town souk \u2014 and had landed just as Syria\u2019s civil war began. My apologies! But not everyone is deterred by warfare or global warming. A batch of new books bridges the gap between the timid and the intrepid wanderer, showing that with planning, a little luck and a modicum of attention to headlines, the world\u2019s most arresting sights, tastes and wonders can still be yours \u2014 whether you conduct your journey in the 50 states, overseas, from the sanctuary of an armchair or from the bobbing back of a camel.",
