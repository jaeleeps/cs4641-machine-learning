When it comes to Asia, the younger Mr. Vongerichten looks not to Thailand, but to Indonesia, the home country of his wife, Ochi Vongerichten, a partner in the venture. This is his first independent move; he is still the executive chef at the West Village restaurant Perry St., owned by his father\u2019s company. So the name, Wayan, meaning \u201cfirst-born\u201d in Bali, is fitting. The front of the restaurant has a marble bar, whitewashed brick walls and a few tables. In a passageway to the main dining room in the rear is a shelf with a display of spices used in Indonesian cooking, like long pepper and turmeric root. There\u2019s greenery throughout for a tropical feel, and the design, by Rockwell Group, includes custom Indonesian decorations. Mr. Vongerichten describes the food, most of it served family-style, as coming from a mixture of cultures, using French techniques to interpret Indonesian classics. There\u2019s avocado and a peanut relish instead of spicy peanut sauce on his gado gado, and a rustic cabbage and egg dish; he is using less of the funky shrimp paste that is ubiquitous in Indonesia. Satays, small plates and bright, fruit-forward cocktails are on the menu, but no rijsttafel. (Opens Monday)",

It shows a crowd in what is now Nigeria, but what was then Yorubaland under British colonial influence. The caption below the photograph reads: \u201cA king of Ejayboo. Governor of Lagos on right. For years the rulers of this fierce tribe made the profession of Christianity a capital crime.\u201d This description is familiar in tone from anthropological literature of the period, though the photograph is hard to date precisely. \u201cEjayboo\u201d is what we would nowadays spell as \u201cIjebu,\u201d a subgroup of Yoruba.

At that time, electricity and telephone companies were simply unwilling to enter rural America: The population was too sparse and the geography too vast. As a result, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Rural Electrification Administration in 1936 to provide loans and grants to rural electric and telephone companies. It was a tremendous success: Within 20 years, 65 percent of farmers had a telephone and 96 percent of them had electricity. ",

Today, travelers come to hike the misty trails linking Sapa to surrounding stopped-in-time villages such as Ta Phin and Cat Cat, whose residents sell handmade brocades and silver jewelry. For the new 249-key H\u00f4tel de la Coupole, set in a mustard-yellow building in Sapa\u2019s Muong Hoa Valley, the Bangkok-based architect and designer Bill Bensley was interested in how, a hundred years ago, these types of artisanal goods made their way to Paris and ended up influencing Western fashions. \u201cI found a 1920s haute couture hat in Paris, which was basically a Vietnamese rattan hat covered in white and red polka dots, and decided to do the entire hotel like that,\u201d he says. To that end, there are cane and velvet barrel chairs in the high-ceilinged cafe, Cacao Patisserie, and, in some of the bedrooms, French lounge chairs covered in graphic hill-tribe fabrics and linen-colored pendant lights draped in tribal silver beads. Bensley, who believes a hotel should be a layered, even intellectual adventure in itself, has also hung some 500 vintage fashion illustrations and ads throughout the property and erected a lobby installation lined with industrial-size bobbins spooled in jewel-toned threads that recall not just vibrant silks but also the lush orchid gardens of nearby Ham Rong Mountain. \u2014 LUCIE ALIG",

The other offers Afrocentric escapism and fantasy: Marlon James\u2019s best-selling new novel, \u201cBlack Leopard, Red Wolf,\u201d draws on ancient myths and recent pop culture as it launches an epic tale about the fight for a lost kingdom.

But this fashion week, the designers presented perhaps their most memorable showstopper yet: a gown (of sorts) which they titled the Big Pretty. A mountain of lilac satin topped by a gift bow the size of a beach ball, it was so wide that it brushed showgoers\u2019 knees on both sides of the runway. The idea was a riff, explains DiCaprio, on an early fashion meme: a series of newspaper cartoons from the 1850s depicting women drowning in excessively large dresses and captioned with a version of \u201cdeath by crinoline.\u201d The oversize bow, meanwhile, evoked a giant housewarming gift. The designers had been thinking about domesticity, an idea that informed looks in pajama-like stripes and a shiny brocade reminiscent of \u201980s-era curtains. They looked, too, at domestic portraits by Tina Barney, whose subjects often seem inseparable from the chintzy d\u00e9cor of their living rooms.",

Hazelton\u2019s poems cast a teasing light over the surface sheen of social norms, the playacting in every relationship: \u201cLet\u2019s pretend to be with other people,\u201d one ends, \u201cuntil we\u2019re with other people.\u201d But beneath their own witty surfaces, the poems also brim with loss and serious moral inquiry. WHEN I WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR, I AM By Jimmy Santiago Baca. (Beacon, paper, $10.95.) Subtitled \u201cAn Immigrant Mother\u2019s Quest,\u201d this book-length poem follows a woman battling obstacles from El Salvador to the United States to secure a better life for her son.

This bilingual volume, pairing Costa\u2019s translations with Amaral\u2019s Portuguese originals, relies on humble imagery and plain language to plumb complicated truths, as in a poem about the brother of the prodigal son: \u201cIt must be a strange thing / loyalty / and how difficult the task / of loving.\u201d TAP OUT By Edgar Kunz. (Mariner, paper, $14.99.) In his debut collection, Kunz charts the gritty, physical terrain of blue-collar masculinity: a workbench made from scrap wood, a night job in an engine shop, a father\u2019s hands with \u201cknuckles more scar / than skin.\u201d STILL LIFE WITH MOTHER AND KNIFE By Chelsea Rathburn. (Louisiana State University, paper, $18.95.) Rathburn\u2019s third book opens with a series of \u201cintroductions\u201d \u2014 to statistics, to home economics, to sex ed \u2014 each illuminating an aspect of modern womanhood, often passed from mother to daughter.",
