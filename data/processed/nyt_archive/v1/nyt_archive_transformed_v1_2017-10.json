Last spring, the family opened Shorty Tang Noodles in Chelsea. Now, they have installed a grand restaurant seating about 350 on three floors in the family-owned building (formerly the Bank of China) next door to where Shorty Tang, who died at 50, opened his original Hwa Yuan restaurant in 1968. (The restaurant closed in the 1980s.) The elder Mr. Tang, now 66, designed the new restaurant, seeing to every detail, including richly hand-carved doors he brought from China. \u201cI\u2019m going to remake history here,\u201d he said. \u201cSesame noodles, fine scallion pancakes, Sichuan kung pao chicken done simply, the way it\u2019s supposed to be, just with chiles and garlic.\u201d He will also serve some banquet dishes on a menu that leans toward Sichuan heat but not exclusively so. He plans to try new ideas, he said, because \u201ctimes have changed.\u201d Among them are raw-bar selections displayed at one end of the bar in the front dining room, and cheesecake for dessert.

My biggest change is that I feel the need to reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians. The wall has always been there, but sometimes there have been too many holes in it. One legitimate criticism of the political press over the last two decades has been the appearance of coziness between people in the media and the political elite. It\u2019s a lot easier for me, say, as a sports fan to accept a personal fandom, whereas in politics, I\u2019m not going to tell anybody whom I vote for, not even my kids, who ask me all the time, because their friends ask them.",

A short word like \u201cquiet\u201d or, in musical terminology, \u201cpiano.\u201d That word, \u201cpiano,\u201d would be repeated. It would be repeated several times. As it was repeated, we would become conscious that it had changed, that in the process of being repeated it had changed, quietly, had expanded from quiet to quietly, imperceptibly. And as this imperceptible change became perceptible, so we would notice that another deeper aspect of its meaning \u2014 also simple \u2014 was making itself felt: a basic figure of speech, a bass figure. Alongside piano and bass something else would emerge, a rustle so faint it could be nothing, a nothing stirring into something that sounds breeze-scattered: a rattle, dimly perceived, moving so slowly it will have to develop significantly before it can be recognized \u2014 measured \u2014 by the form of time known, since the dawn of time, as rhythm and, later, as percussion. At some point \u2014 though the key point is that we will not be able to say with certainty when, where or how this point was achieved \u2014 piano, bass and drums will have moved either into a deep propulsive groove or into a maelstrom of relentless intensity. And then, after an extended stretch of time, the music will subside \u2014 or plunge \u2014 back to the silence from which it emerged faintly, quietly.

Kubitschek calls himself a conservative, battling to preserve Germany\u2019s \u201cethno-cultural identity,\u201d which he says is threatened by immigration and the alienating effects of modernity. He identifies as part of the German \u201cNew Right,\u201d which seeks to dissociate itself from the \u201cold right,\u201d which in Germany means Nazis.

Kubitschek, however, presents his views with a disarming, Teutonic idealism that recalls a Germany that long preceded the rise of Hitler.

For the chefs Scott Tacinelli and Angie Rito, who have been cooking together since 2008, most recently at Quality Italian in Midtown Manhattan, their dream was to own a restaurant. They married in Florence, Italy, in 2015, and now they have their restaurant, a fairly intimate yet airy 58-seat space, done in white with rich marble accents. Both chefs are Italian-American, he from New Jersey and she from Cleveland. They\u2019re putting a personal spin on some classics, like dressing garganelli with a \u201cbroken meatball\u201d sauce, putting escargots instead of clams in a preparation for oreganata, using prime rib to make a braciola for two, and tossing a Caesar salad with chrysanthemum greens instead of romaine. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely on the same page when it comes to food,\u201d Ms. Rito said. Her husband added, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy cooking together, but I trust Angie\u2019s palate more than my own.\u201d They\u2019re also specializing in \u201cred\u201d amaro aperitifs, and the house wine, Don Angie Cali Chianti, is a Sangiovese from California and comes in a bottle wrapped in old-fashioned straw: 103 Greenwich Avenue (12th Street), 212-889-8884, donangienyc.com.",

I am sure that is accurate for some, but I imagine that what is identified as love is probably thoroughness and follow-through and taking the time that work-done-properly takes. What you unfortunately don\u2019t get to hear very often (unless you work in kitchens) is how sharp and droll and cynical and pragmatic chefs can be too. I\u2019m not saying you can taste it in the food, but every kitchen everywhere has a charming and agreeable dose of jadedness \u2014 a vaguely begrudging eye roll expressed most commonly when it comes to menu-planning time in the observation \u201cYou could throw your grandmother on the grill with goat cheese and artichokes and sell a thousand plates a night.\u201d",

About 2.7 billion years ago, basalt lava flowed underwater near what\u2019s now the state\u2019s border with Canada; the lava hardened, and the creep of geologic time turned it into a bedrock of greenstone and granite. On top of it, a layer of sedimentary rock rich in iron ore formed nearly two billion years ago, when the region was ocean floor. Then a billion years ago, Earth\u2019s crust cracked open, producing a 50-mile-wide fissure stretching from Lake Superior to Kansas. For the next 100 million years, lava bubbled up into what geologists call the Midcontinent Rift, forming a mineral deposit filled with copper and nickel. Settlers first made their way to the area in 1865 in a fruitless search for gold. What they did find was iron ore, and lots of it. Rails were laid for iron-ore transport, and the town of Ely was founded a few years later, in 1888.",

Today\u2019s 3-D movies use digital projection, but that stereoscopic effect was originally achieved by having two overlapping images projected from strips of film. The revival of 3-D cheese-fests in the 1980s afforded a rite of passage to some rising stars of the decade, including Molly Ringwald in \u201cSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone 3-D\u201d (Oct. 13), Dennis Quaid in \u201cJaws 3-D\u201d (Oct. 15 and Oct. 17) and Demi Moore in \u201cParasite 3-D\u201d (Oct. 18). But the attraction of a retrospective like the Quad\u2019s is a chance to see rare formats in action. Arch Oboler\u2019s \u201cThe Bubble\u201d (Oct. 14), from 1966, was recently restored for digital projection, but the Quad will present it in its original 35-millimeter \u201cSpace-Vision.\u201d Instead of two projectors running simultaneously \u2014 one for each eye \u2014 as was the practice in the 1950s, Space-Vision achieved the 3-D effect using one projector and one film strip with two images in every frame. This will be the first known screening of the original roadshow version since Mr. Oboler cut the film by more than 20 minutes in 1968, says Robert Furmanek, founder and chief executive of the 3-D Film Archive. 212-255-2243, quadcinema.com",

Twitter is ablaze with other women and men sharing their own stories of sexual misconduct at the hands of the powerful, spawning conversations about power and fame, privilege and punishment. The aftermath has raised questions about the commonality of harassment \u2014 and has forced us to confront our own complacency. We were compelled to talk about the cultural petri dish that allows assault and abuse to perpetuate and about what might be changing, socially and technologically, that is encouraging survivors to come forward. We also discuss the recently released \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d which somehow felt lacking, as if science fiction can\u2019t keep up with the reality of the moment we\u2019re living through.

My character was an awkward girl, bumbling, in fact, who wore sweatshirts and jeans, and had little sense of her sexual power. But this was how they were going to sell the movie, and at a certain point, I was tired of being a problem, which is how a female actor is invariably treated whenever she points out that she is being objectified or not respected.",

Fried dishes, kushiyaki skewers, plus sushi, sashimi, rolls, salads, soup and desserts round out the menu. All served in a subdued and elegant setting decorated with handmade ceramic tiles.

Then I heard about the Prison University Project, an on-site degree-granting college program at San Quentin, and so I started teaching a history-of-photography class. For about three years, I worked on an audio project about life inside the prison, and the local public radio station found out and offered to train us.

From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Bronx Zoo offers a Haunted Forest, with both wildlife models and scary apparitions, and the Extinct Species Graveyard, a fake cemetery devoted to a real threat: vanishing creatures. Other attractions include presentations of live birds associated with Halloween, like owls, ravens and vultures, and a costume parade with stilt walkers from Alice Farley Dance Theater, above. The Queens Zoo\u2019s festivities, also 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., include holiday treats for wildlife \u2014 meat-stuffed pumpkins, for example \u2014 and a haunted trail for people. The Prospect Park Zoo, whose \u201cBoo\u201d runs 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a Spooky Barn, is focusing on bats, whose activities are more helpful than horrifying.

But Mason wasn\u2019t deterred: He trained at the Otis and Chouinard art institutes under master ceramists Susan Peterson and Peter Voulkos, and was among the first artists to show at L.A.\u2019s now-iconic Ferus Gallery, known for championing art that bridged the gap between high and low. (Warhol\u2019s soup cans debuted there in 1962, as did John Altoon\u2019s lyrical, quasi-Abstract Expressionist \u201cOcean Park\u201d paintings.) In the decades since, the now-90-year-old Mason has become renowned for his simple geometric forms (spears, crosses and torqued pillars), which he fires in a room-size kiln in his downtown L.A. studio. An upcoming solo show at Albertz Benda gallery in N.Y.C. will highlight some of his towering columnar works, along with more intimately proportioned, pedestal-friendly sculptures, most of them never previously seen. Some unfold vertically like the gills of an accordion, swiveling effortlessly up from their bases; others stand stoically, their smooth surfaces defined by crisp edges. Glazed in rich, earthy hues like turquoise and burnt umber, they are arresting reminders of an artist who superseded the technical limits of clay \u2014 as well as the superficial opposition of art and craft, paving the way for later artists such as Sterling Ruby and Brie Ruais. \u2014 LIZ HIRSCH",

Enter the restaurant up some stairs, and you go straight to the counter where the action is. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely new design, and it\u2019s much better,\u201d he said. Last spring, poised to open, he and his business partner, Nastassia Lopez, decided their kitchen plan wasn\u2019t working, so they had the whole thing rebuilt to make the pasta assembly line more efficient, always with an eye on the stopwatch. Mr. Ladner\u2019s combination of speed and quality at a low price involves a freezing method. He offers three types of pastas with a basic marinara sauce for $6 to $7; adding pesto or meat costs another dollar, and 50 cents gets you a topping like cheese. Beverages include wine.
