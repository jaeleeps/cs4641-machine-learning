			"lead_paragraph": "The joy of inversion animated the work of Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel, the eminent 20th-century couturier who never encountered a convention she didn\u2019t want to subvert. Gender, especially, fascinated her. Liberating women from corsetry \u2014 putting them in trouser suits, chemises, short skirts and sporty leisure wear \u2014 radically advanced the course of modern feminism while making Chanel an international icon. But reimagining the shape of women\u2019s clothing, and thus their silhouette in the world, was only one aspect of her revolutionary spirit: By purloining traditional men\u2019s wear fabrics, she entirely upended notions of women as decorative and pliant. Tweed, developed as a humble workingman\u2019s cloth in Scotland in the 1700s and adopted a century later by the duck-hunting English upper class, ranked among her favorite textiles. In the 1950s, she introduced the nubby skirt suit in Linton tweed, variations of which are still a signature style of the house that bears her name. Now, Chanel has developed a new 45-piece high jewelry collection that uses an interwoven articulation of precious metals and stones to evoke the earthiness of that material. With a cascade of white and yellow diamonds in an encyclopedic variety of cuts and sizes, these dangling earrings conjure the informal, unpretentious warp and weft that captured the designer\u2019s renegade imagination so many years ago.",

And so along came convertible jewelry \u2014 a single piece that could be configured in multiple ways. The most famous of these was Van Cleef & Arpels\u2019s Zip necklace, with diamond teeth that could be zipped up to become a bracelet. The Surrealist design was suggested to the jeweler by Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, in 1938 after one of Simpson\u2019s favorite couturiers, Elsa Schiaparelli, began to use the newfangled fastener on her designs instead of buttons. Today, the Paris-based house continues to experiment with such chameleonic creations, most recently this massive articulated collar with a detachable pendant and brooch. Adorned with more than 60 large rubies and a veritable mine of white diamonds, the two roses, which can be worn together as a clip, were fashioned by a proprietary method in which stones are set almost invisibly in a sculpturelike armature. The monumental piece, whether pinned to a lapel or draped around the neck, may not be built for practicality this time around, but it surely illustrates the beauty of always remaining adaptable.",

Westerners have never quite understood the reverence in Japan for fugu, alternately known in English as puffer fish, globefish or blowfish, of the family Tetraodontidae. A sluggish swimmer, fugu has stunted fins and often flat-lying spikes instead of scales, and when confronted by predators it compensates for its lack of speed by swallowing enough water to swell up until its spikes stand on end, so it looks like an angry armored balloon. Among those who think of fugu as merely a distant delicacy, knowledge rarely goes beyond the fish\u2019s infamous trait: In the most delicious species, the innards are suffused with the neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX).

Late Sunday afternoon, the countdown passed the halfway point. I like the collective act of building a list. I like the story it tells about the art form and the people who claim to love it.

In mid-March, he finished the sound mix for \u201cCity Hall,\u201d his 45th feature, just as Emmanuel Macron announced a national lockdown. As fall arrived, with his new four-and-a-half-hour documentary opening at largely virtual film festivals (Venice, New York, Toronto) to rapturous reviews, Wiseman, who in a normal year would have walked one or more of the red carpets, remained sidelined in France, thousands of miles from his family and unable to begin his next project. It was the first time in 55 years he hadn\u2019t been working on a film, Wiseman told me. When I asked how he\u2019d been holding up, he noted flatly, \u201cWell, in addition to being scared, I\u2019m bored.\u201d His doctors had advised him not to fly, \u201cprimarily,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m of the age Covid likes.\u201d Wiseman will celebrate his 91st birthday on New Year\u2019s Day.",

			"lead_paragraph": "Editors\u2019 Note [Dec. 18, 2020]: In 2018, The Times released a 12-part narrative podcast series called \u201cCaliphate\u201d on the Islamic State terrorist group and its operations. While parts of the series involved a broad examination of the group\u2019s tactics and influence, multiple episodes were driven primarily by the confessional tale of a Canadian man of Pakistani origin who called himself Abu Huzayfah and claimed to have been a member of the Islamic State who had taken part in killings in Syria.During the course of reporting for the series, The Times discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies in Huzayfah\u2019s story. The Times took a number of steps, including seeking confirmation of details from intelligence officials in the United States, to find independent evidence of Huzayfah\u2019s story. The decision was made to proceed with the project but to include an episode, Chapter 6, devoted to exploring major discrepancies and highlighting the fact-checking process that sought to verify key elements of the narrative. In September \u2014 two and a half years after the podcast was released \u2014 the Canadian police arrested Huzayfah, whose real name is Shehroze Chaudhry, and charged him with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. Canadian officials say they believe that Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s account of supposed terrorist activity is completely fabricated. The hoax charge led The Times to investigate what Canadian officials had discovered, and to re-examine Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s account and the earlier efforts to determine its validity. This new examination found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the \u201cCaliphate\u201d podcast.As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of \u201cCaliphate\u201d that presented Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s claims did not meet our standards for accuracy.From the outset, \u201cCaliphate\u201d should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter. In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individual\u2019s account. For example, reporters and editors could have vetted more thoroughly materials Mr. Chaudhry provided for evidence that he had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, and pushed harder and earlier to determine what the authorities knew about him. It is also clear that elements of the original fact-checking process were not sufficiently rigorous: Times journalists were too credulous about the verification steps that were undertaken and dismissive of the lack of corroboration of essential aspects of Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s account. In the absence of firmer evidence, \u201cCaliphate\u201d should have been substantially revised to exclude the material related to Mr. Chaudhry. The podcast as a whole should not have been produced with Mr. Chaudhry as a central narrative character.A fuller description of what The Times has learned about Mr. Chaudhry was published on Dec. 18, 2020.

He had come from the N.F.L., where his most recent job was chief operating officer for the Minnesota Vikings. The first African-American commissioner of a major college conference, he had almost no experience in college sports. He was regarded as an outsider, a perception he shared. To help overcome that, Warren had intended to hold a town-hall meeting on each of the 14 Big Ten campuses during his first year as commissioner. The conference fielded 350 teams across 28 sports, and Warren planned to see every one of them in action. When the pandemic hit in early March, he had seen 105 teams play and hosted three town halls. He still barely knew the university presidents and chancellors, who hired him, or the athletic directors. Unlike his predecessor, Jim Delany, whose tenure as commissioner lasted three decades, Warren had no particular friends or allies among either group. And now he faced one of the most consequential decisions in conference history: Should the Big Ten play football in 2020?",
