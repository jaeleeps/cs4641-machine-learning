A Donner party dress,\u201d another tweeted; \u201cThe sister wives and I all decided to go with turd brown,\u201d added a third. Considering our current moment\u2019s heart-poundingly swift, frequently terrifying news cycle, the Sequoia affair hardly made for the most momentous or enduring story.

In 1991, at the age of 23, Yahagi left Japan for New York City, where she opened a bakery with her then-husband near Union Square. But an old issue of Vogue Bambini inspired a new direction. \u201cIt had these timeless images of kids in outfits by Comme des Garc\u0327ons that looked like wonderful school uniforms and papa\u2019s clothes,\u201d she remembers; she set up her shop eight years later. There, hidden like little treasures among her garments, is a selection of carefully chosen housewares \u2014 paper-thin Japanese terry cloth towels, striped porcelain bowls \u2014 that she finds on her monthly trips to Paris and Tokyo, where she also maintains a larger Makie outpost. On the days she isn\u2019t traveling, you\u2019ll find the 53-year-old flitting about her Thompson Street location, dressed in her signature uniform: a navy frayed-twill blazer and cropped trousers of her own design, plus a stack of gold-and-opal rings.

Any connection between this new restaurant and the space\u2019s former tenant, Brasserie, is tenuous. Jeff Zalaznick, a co-owner, is instead calling it a Japanese brasserie. \u201cI love the name, and it reminds me of places in Japan with similar names,\u201d he said. The Lobster Club might suggest Japan to Mr. Zalaznick, but New Yorkers are more likely to remember an Upper East Side restaurant of that name from the chef Anne Rosenzweig. Now Japan prevails, with the chef, Tasuku Murakami, in the kitchen. There is lobster to be sure, seared on a teppan griddle, in a cocktail, a salad, and dumplings. But the menu is as much steakhouse as it is brasserie, with a long list of sushi and sashimi items as well. The restaurant, which cost $10 million to design and build and was done by the designer Peter Marino, who also created the colorful tableware, is as much inviting lounge as it is restaurant. Framed by a long, bright bar along one side with flooring that suggests Jackson Pollock\u2019s work, some of the midcentury Modern style furnishings upholstered in pink and chartreuse are low, conducive to drinking and snacking. Off to one side is another dining room, which can be closed for private parties, done in vibrant red and adorned with Mr. Marino\u2019s interpretations of Picasso sculptures.

But he also wants to be profoundly lost and unknown. He lives in the street and yearns to move silently among people who don\u2019t recognize him.\u201d Below, Mr. Smith talks about first learning of Mr. Frank in a rock magazine in the 1970s, how \u201cAmerican Witness\u201d became darker and more ambiguous as he wrote it, his fascination with one of the Three Stooges, and more.",

What was good about the Vanity Fair era was that I wrote so much. These days, the only place I really do my diary is on my laptop on a plane back from Davos or L.A. or London. But back in the pre-digital age, I had those black-and-white marbled composition notebooks and new New Yorker eyes (because I\u2019d just arrived from London) and I was so wired with everything I was seeing that I had a desire to write it, share it, impart it. I love reading other people\u2019s diaries, too: Virginia Woolf\u2019s, Andy Cohen\u2019s. Chips Channon was a huge inspiration to me; the Tory M.P.\u2019s diaries through the \u201930s and \u201940s where he interfaced between society and politics \u2014 it\u2019s just riveting stuff. As for myself, I\u2019m at my most prolific when something new is happening and I\u2019m on my own somewhere. There\u2019s nothing like that caught-in-the-moment, onrushing immediacy of a diary.

My sources ranged from books so rare and technical that I couldn\u2019t get them in physical form \u2014 Navy deep sea diving manuals from the 1940s, for example \u2014 to literary classics I had never read, like Henry Roth\u2019s \u201cCall It Sleep,\u201d Nella Larsen\u2019s \u201cPassing\u201d and Luc Sante\u2019s \u201cLow Life.\u201d In the end, fiction proved most revealing of the mood and textures and collective memory of the period \u2014 even a flawed novel could teach me a lot, and cheesy detective fiction was indispensible. I tried to keep all my reading together on the shelves of an antique desk I bought years ago from a relative. I would stand in front of the growing mass of books and run my eyes over them as I waited for a synthesis to coalesce in my mind of the many worlds I was trying to internalize.

There was just one Clark Kent who ducked into phone booths and emerged as Superman, one Bruce Wayne who slid down the Batpole to get suited up as Batman. But times are no longer simple. As the DC comic-book characters become more central to the ambitions of Warner Brothers, they appear in more and more TV shows and movie franchises. Where it once took decades to arrive at a single film in which Batman and Superman finally threw down, now there are numerous fictional worlds that exist side by side \u2014 intersecting occasionally, or not at all \u2014 where these champions reside and do battle, and even multiple versions of the same characters across several properties. It can all be very confusing. Is there a way to solve this crisis on infinite Earths? Probably not, but this visual guide to the DC media universe will help explain just how complicated it has become.",

So in 1885 he hired the Russian goldsmith Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 to stop time. The resulting bejeweled masterpiece, a gift for the czar\u2019s wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna, would come to symbolize our never-ending quest: to render the ephemeral permanent, to embellish nature and interpret it anew. From oak spice boxes carved in the shape of geese in South India to a chocolate cake decorated by a British baker to resemble a pheasant straight off the spit, artisans have always toyed with verisimilitude, making twisted versions of familiar things, recreating them in dazzling, unexpected materials, bending their forms to reveal their essence. Consider it Pirandellian magic: Now you see it; now you really see it. ",

Born to a Swedish mother and an Italian father, the Milan native has an aesthetic that marries a Southern European passion for color and craftsmanship with a Scandinavian appreciation for efficiency and minimalism. His influences range from Japanese metro stations to old masters; his Instagram account (@mzmarcozanini) is an eclectic anthology of images of \u201990s fashion, Brutalist architecture, scraps of vintage fabric, even children\u2019s toys \u2014 all of which inform both his apartment in Milan and his designs for Santoni. The company had focused on handcrafted shoes since 1975, but since Zanini joined last year, it has debuted a micro-collection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing and accessories (many of them unisex) for a sub-brand called Santoni Edited by Marco Zanini. \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been very set on leaving out what\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d says Zanini, whose pared-down designs, such as a cashmere coat reinforced with hand-sewn goose down and a military cotton trench lined in raspberry and chestnut Japanese satin, exhibit couture-level craftsmanship. \u201cI like things that take a little extra effort to get or to make.\u201d",

The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles. A block farther on, all was quiet again. This small, perfect town felt as if I\u2019d dreamed it, a hermetic Mediterranean fantasy, a curious and singular combination of Arab influence and profound Catholicism, the stretching vista of sandy earth and olive trees descending to the impeccable azure sea, punctuated by an occasional British red postbox.",
