The book is, no surprise, every bit as rowdy as the movie. Haddish grew up in foster care in South Central Los Angeles, and for a time had a job as an \u201cenergy producer\u201d at bar mitzvahs, where she was paid to dance enthusiastically and encourage other guests to have a good time. (\u201cI was basically the Flava Flav of bar mitzvahs.\u201d) In one memorable chapter, she explains how that gig led to a sideline pimping out her male friends. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing bar mitzvahs, you\u2019re going to meet old Jewish ladies,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey started telling me how lonely they were and saying things like, \u2018My husband\u2019s not satisfying me.\u2019\u201d When one woman showed Haddish her collection of romance novels \u2014 \u201cShe had one that was like a slave thing or whatever. It was a big, strapping black guy on the cover, holding this passed-out white woman\u201d \u2014 Haddish was inspired. \u201cI don\u2019t know any slaves,\u201d she told the woman, \u201cbut I could probably hook you up with somebody big and strong.\u201d Word spread, and Haddish thrived until the men realized they could cut their own deals without her. That\u2019s O.K. She\u2019s found other ways to put her people skills to lucrative use. On the copyright page, her publishers suggest stores file the book under \u201cBiography and autobiography / Rich and famous.\u201d",

She remembers her time at Oxford in flashbacks throughout the night. The timely novel explores themes of feminism, religious devotion, secular doubt and political upheaval. Born in France, where her father was studying at the time, Ms. Shafak has lived in many places, including Spain and the United States. For the past eight years, she has divided her time between London and Istanbul. Below, she discusses the importance of women\u2019s voices, the artists who helped her find her own confidence and more.",

Blockson. Given to him by Tubman\u2019s great-grandniece Mariline Wilkins (the daughter of Eva Stewart Northrup, whose signature is inscribed inside the book\u2019s cover), it was just one of dozens of Tubman\u2019s belongings bequeathed to the museum that day. Eric Williams, the curator of religion at the Smithsonian\u2019s Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, considers the book particularly revelatory, given that Tubman was illiterate. \u201cThis idea of having a sacred book and not being able to read it,\u201d he said in a phone interview, \u201cthat\u2019s a window into her piety. And it is in line with a longer tradition one finds in the black religious experience in North America.\u201d Although many black men and women, whether enslaved or free, could not read them, he explained, \u201cthese books \u2014 the Bible and hymnals \u2014 bore witness to the liberating power of the Gospel contained within their pages.\u201d Williams told me that for Tubman, who could sing every word it contains, this hymnal would have been \u201cinvested with a spiritual power,\u201d and that it is a text to be valued \u201cnot just as literature but as artifact \u2014 as an object of devotion.\u201d ",

But the rest of the menu looks to Asia for inspiration, offering soup dumplings, chicken won tons, rock shrimp tempura, chicken yakitori, crispy spring rolls and a deep list of sushi specialties. The restaurateur Stratis Morfogen, who has partnered with the former owner of Rothmann\u2019s, Franco Moscato, for this venture, said this restaurant is not a typical Asian steakhouse, like the Korean and Japanese places around town. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing Asian about the steaks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everything else is Asian.\u201d Skinny Mei, who was at Philippe and Jue Lan Club, and Albert Diaz, who was the head chef at Zuma in London and Miami, run the kitchen. The 175-seat restaurant, dramatically done in gray and black with plush red banquettes and clusters of globe lights, has a bar on the ground floor, a dining room a half-flight up and another dining room on the next level. It will serve lunch and dinner on opening day. (Opens Tuesday): 116 East 60th Street, 212-256-1929, jadesixty.com.",

This year is the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, and a new biography of Martin Luther attempts to make him attractive to a general audience. Simon Schama continues his panoramic \u201cThe Story of the Jews\u201d with his second volume, \u201cBelonging: 1492-1900.\u201d Christopher de Hamel offers a view into the stunning world of illuminated manuscripts, Garry Wills studies the Quran and Tova Mirvis tells her story of leaving the community of Modern Orthodox Judaism. On the secular side of things, we suggest a haunting memoir about surviving sexual assault, a collection of stories by P. D. James and an absorbing history of coffee.",
