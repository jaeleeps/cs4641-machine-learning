He makes impossible last-second game-winning shots as casually as the rest of us might toss our car keys into a bowl on the coffee table. Once, using the subtlest of shot fakes, Durant sent LeBron James sliding helplessly to the floor, out of bounds, and then cruised politely forward for two points.

Sure, Freddie Mercury and his bandmates were from England, but Queen\u2019s music continues to reverberate across American culture, a phenomenon this Academy Award-winning biopic explores. Rami Malek (wearing a convincing set of prosthetic teeth) plays the Queen frontman in the film, which charts the band\u2019s dazzling rise and experimental songwriting, alongside some of Mercury\u2019s personal struggles. Although Malek\u2019s performance earned him an Oscar for best actor, the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that the film doesn\u2019t do enough to capture \u201cthe glorious and unlikely artifice of Queen itself, a band whose scrambling of sexual and musical codes remains a remarkable phenomenon in the history of popular culture.\u201d",

Some said the series lacked novelty and that the Ghostface killer doesn\u2019t send chills down your spine over 10 drawn-out episodes. Season 3 brings the show from MTV to VH1 and packs terror in three two-hour episodes airing over three nights. The unlucky protagonist is Deion (RJ Cyler), a high school jock in Atlanta who is haunted by the death of his brother and by a mysterious killer who is sending him eerie messages. After Deion lands in detention, he and a few classmates form the \u201cDeadfast Club\u201d and set out to find the man behind the mask. As in previous seasons, \u201cResurrection\u201d offers plenty of meta references: One character plainly states, \u201cWe\u2019re in a horror movie.\u201d Another says, \u201cThis here is a reboot, and reboots don\u2019t play by your rules.\u201d ",

Elena Ferrante\u2019s beloved Neapolitan Novels (and the ongoing HBO adaptation of them) \u2014 along with the gritty \u201cGomorrah\u201d books, movie and TV series \u2014 has roused curiosity about a destination long considered little more than a steppingstone to Capri, Ischia and Amalfi. And while the Museo Archeologico, with its extraordinary collection of antiquities, remains a bit neglected, most of the city\u2019s art, culture and social scene are on an optimistic bender, and the charms of Naples \u2014 the Baroque excess, the indulgent cuisine, the mesmerizing fugue state of it all \u2014 beckon as they did in the city\u2019s Grand Tour glory days.",

The latest evidence of Yoakum\u2019s originality is this enthralling exhibition, among the largest ever devoted to his work. It features nearly 70 of the artist\u2019s delirious vistas of undulant hills, mountains and rock formations, variously striated, patterned and creviced, rendered in pale browns and pastels of colored pencil burnished to resemble watercolor. Defined by double outlines, Yoakum\u2019s geological elements have a curious autonomy: They heave, lean and push against one another, but they also evoke soft creased flesh, voluptuous but slightly abstracted. Sudden breaks in the terrain offer views of tiny trees, distorting space and scale and intensifying the sexual undercurrent.",

While this Oscar-winning drama about Neil Armstrong touches on the space race and the political issues the moon landing raised at home, it focuses on the personal and professional setbacks Armstrong overcame before taking that small step in 1969. \u201cFeelings are the film\u2019s fuel,\u201d A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. \u201cLike some of the ancient epics \u2018First Man\u2019 is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center.\" Ryan Gosling, collaborating with \u201cLa La Land\u201d director Damien Chazelle for the second time, portrays the astronaut in the years leading up to the Apollo 11 launch. The screenplay draws from James R. Hansen\u2019s biography and contrasts Armstrong\u2019s reserved, hard-to-read temperament with the larger-than-life job he has shouldered. We watch as he and his wife (Claire Foy) grieve over the loss of their daughter, prepare for the launch and wrestle with the fact that Armstrong could go down in history as the first man to walk on the moon \u2014 or perish in outer space.

After President Trump took office, many parents in the immigrant community started to give Sandigo power of attorney, so that she could make decisions for their United States-born children, should they be deported. This designation protects the children in Sandigo\u2019s care from entering the foster care system, keeping them from being legally separated from their parents. When Sandigo is not making grocery runs, contacting lawyers or trying to find beds for the hundreds of people she looks after, she makes trips to Washington to meet with lawmakers to discuss immigration policy. The filmmakers Dave LaMattina and Chad Walker followed Sandigo over two years during and following the 2016 election for this documentary.",

Ten years ago, Tarantino and Pitt joined forces in this gruesome action flick, whose title, minus the misspellings, was borrowed from Enzo G. Castellari\u2019s 1978 war movie. Set in Nazi-occupied France, the story follows two separate plots to bring an end to the Third Reich that ultimately converge: There\u2019s a band of Jewish-American soldiers \u2014 the so-called basterds \u2014 who land in France to scalp and kill Nazis, and then there\u2019s a vengeful Jewish-French woman (Melanie Laurent) who runs a movie theater under a pseudonym.

The chefs and partners, Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, decided to incorporate the word \u201cred,\u201d often used in China, in the name, which also refers to the story, already an internet chronicle, of Kyle MacDonald, who parlayed a red paper clip into a two-story house after a series of trades. \u201cIt\u2019s our philosophy, always moving forward, moving up,\u201d Mr. Chen said. So far, the two men, who have no formal culinary training and met while working several years ago at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, have gone from the bottom of the professional kitchen ladder to working in New York establishments like Soho House; One if by Land, Two if by Sea; and the Dutch, as well as Alinea, in Chicago, and Apis, near Austin, Tex. Before opening Red Paper Clip, a bootstrap affair with no backers, they held pop-up dinners in various places, including an Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Chen, 29, a New Yorker whose parents are from Taiwan, and Mr. Gyamtso, also 29, a Tibetan who came to New York in 2008, are doing all the cooking in an open kitchen at the back of the unadorned 24-seat dining room. (There are eight seats at the bar.) John Parson, the manager, takes care of the beverages. Their food is contemporary, with elements like miso, black garlic, beef tendon and chiles. \u201cThe part of Tibet where I\u2019m from is in the east, near Sichuan, so I favor strong flavors,\u201d Mr. Gyamtso said. Mr. Chen said characteristic dishes include oysters with yuzu kosho mignonette, and beef carpaccio with Sichuan seasonings, puffed tendon and coriander. They\u2019ll continue to serve those dishes when they switch from \u00e0 la carte to a tasting menu format in about six weeks. They\u2019re just waiting for a new sous-chef to arrive from Texas. ",

The principal figure through which that story gets dissected is Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica executive who became an outspoken defector. Also interviewed are the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie and the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who was an author of a collaborative report between The Times and The Observer that exposed how Cambridge Analytica harvested the information of tens of millions of Facebook users. In that article, Wylie described the company as an \u201carsenal of weapons\u201d in a culture war. This documentary picks apart those weapons, and their effects.",

In the morning, she receives a barrage of text massages from friends alerting her to a grainy video that\u2019s been circulating.

Ms. Feiring, whose middle name should be \u201cterroir,\u201d starts by describing what natural wine is not: It lacks the fruit, power and oak of some high-end wines. Ms. Feiring takes the same approach to wine as she does to food, avoiding anything highly processed and additive-laden, and explains all the additives used in conventional wine production that natural winemakers don\u2019t use. But she also gets into weedy details; amateurs might prefer to ignore sections on stuff like reverse-osmosis and infusion, and concentrate instead on how wine gets its color, the use or presence of sulfur in wine, how to find natural wines and why you should care. And if you\u2019re planning a trip to France or a few other countries and want to visit natural wineries, she includes some guidance.",
