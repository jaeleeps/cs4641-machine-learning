Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because they\u2019re tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. They\u2019re fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasn\u2019t asking for serious art. Still, they\u2019d often protest, \u201cI can\u2019t draw!\u201d before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: \u201cThis is great!\u201d she said, adding a carrot. Others (I\u2019ve amassed 70 of these over the years), both reluctant and charmed, would sigh a \u201chere goes\u201d as I counted to 10.",

Now the building\u2019s co-owners and managers, Rose Associates, have brought in this new team. The restaurant, an airy space with high ceilings in ivory and butterscotch, has two dining areas, with the kitchen, an immense stainless-steel island, to one side. Mr. Kent\u2019s menu is eclectic and creative. Dishes include cauliflower Parmigiano, grilled pears with feta and pistachio pesto, roasted sunchokes with Cheddar and hazelnuts, and glazed farro with bone marrow (farro marrow?) and oxtail. Larger plates for sharing include roasted short ribs, grilled chicken with hot sauce, and butterflied branzino. The pastry chef, Renata Ameni, who was at Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., will serve a sticky toffee pudding for sharing. (Opens Tuesday)",

One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprin\u2019s late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952. Since its construction, artistic heirs of Halprin, including Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk, have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her. An esteemed teacher and performer, Halprin is known for her use of scores, or task-based improvisations, as well as for making dances inspired by nature. Once outside, a pair of students inspected some overhead branches and then offered full-body impressions of leaves rustling in the wind.",

A group of artists, academics and medical professionals now maintain a resource-rich version of the website (graphicmedicine.org), sponsor an annual international conference and oversee a book series. In 2015 they issued the \u201cGraphic Medicine Manifesto,\u201d a part-prose, part-comics title this paper reviewed favorably.

Lois Pritchard, 40, single and a secret smoker, wears a sharp black bob and pointy high-heeled boots. A general practitioner, she also works part time at the local Genitourinary Medicine clinic, treating various problems of genital and urinary origins that the book selectively illustrates, including numerous S.T.D.s (\u201cmuck in the fuel pipe,\u201d as one man puts it).",

The problem: Kat has no use for boys; she\u2019s got her sights set on college.

While Africa Command would not confirm to The Times its use of ground-attack aircraft in the region, Amnesty International found photographs of an American airstrike site that showed the remains of a GBU-69 Small Glide Munition, a bomb that can be dropped only using a C.L.T., which in this instance was fitted to an AC-130 gunship.",
