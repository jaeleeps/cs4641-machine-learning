In searching for his own place in the world, he has discovered answers for the challenges that everyone faces.\u201d If this isn\u2019t meant at least 50 percent in jest \u2014 again, it helps to append \u201cin bed\u201d to each item \u2014 then Coelho\u2019s pharmacological dalliance may not be entirely a thing of the past.",

The spacious double storefront from 1848, on the increasingly attractive stretch of Eighth Street west of Fifth Avenue, looks as if it was worth the wait. Whitewashed brick walls contain a barroom and a bilevel dining room decorated simply, with a nod to midcentury modern. Mr. Kluger\u2019s food is seasonal and market driven. And it builds on his experience working with chefs like Floyd Cardoz at Tabla, which shapes the flavors in his suckling pig and on his cauliflower with Indian seasonings, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten at ABC Kitchen, which inspired a vegetable focus on the menu. Local sourcing is so important to him that he\u2019s grinding wheat from upstate for pasta extruded in-house. (Opens Saturday): 21 West Eighth Street, 212-388-1831, loringplacenyc.com.",

An exquisitely carved ivory lion\u2019s head from the eighth or ninth century B.C. has roots in Near Eastern visual traditions shared with Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Christian, Jewish and Islamic influences also came into play and mingled. Throughout all of this, there were periods of murderous struggle. More remarkable, there were even longer stretches of multicultural peace. By closing with contemporary Syrian works, the show suggests that, against all present evidence, there could be peace again.

Before the meeting, Mr. Trudeau set out a plan where the price \u2014 either through a fossil fuel tax or a cap-and-trade system of emission allowances \u2014 would reach 50 Canadian dollars, or about $38, a metric ton, or 2,205 pounds, over five years. He also warned that provinces that did not buy in would have the price imposed on them. During the presidential election campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would pull the United States out of the climate change commitments made by the Obama administration. Some Canadians, mostly Conservative politicians, say the economy will be in jeopardy if Canada goes ahead with carbon pricing in the absence of American action. But when I looked into the debate, I also found people who argued that moving now on carbon emissions could give Canada a competitive advantage.",

Twice a week, instead of driving to his laboratory at the Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital, he headed to the medical-school campus about a mile away. There, he joined some 20 students learning to pipette liquid extracts into gels and stain them with pigments to figure out which protein molecules they contained. Burks had only recently completed his medical fellowship, where he studied why some children have allergic reactions to milk and eggs. Now he was throwing himself into biochemistry so he could be the first to figure out what it was about peanuts that made people so allergic. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say you want to do something that\u2019ll change kids\u2019 lives,\u201d Burks says. \u201cBut you have to focus on an area to really get it done.\u201d",

That\u2019s what has inspired his new casual venture into Southern fare. \u201cIt can be healthy,\u201d he said. The fried chicken and biscuits are available with or without gluten, as are the mac and cheese, potpies, several sandwiches and some of the desserts. He makes his own gluten-free flour, and cooks his grits in coconut milk, to accommodate dairy-free diets. The dozen or so sides are based mostly on organic vegetables, and there are also rotisserie chickens. The restaurant will be in a small space with exposed brick, a sleek bar and 22 seats indoors, 20 outside.

They know it, too. Here\u2019s John Grisham \u2014 whose thriller \u201cThe Whistler\u201d remains No. 1 in its ninth week on the hardcover fiction list \u2014 describing his target audience in a November interview with Slate: \u201cFirst of all, she\u2019s female, because two-thirds of all books are bought by women. She\u2019s going to buy it during the Christmas season, because 35 percent of all books are sold during the Christmas season. I would guess she\u2019s probably going to be over 40, because they buy more books than under 40. And that kind of narrows it down. That\u2019s probably my typical reader.\u201d In the same interview, Grisham said he often writes from a sense of injustice about a given subject \u2014 don\u2019t be surprised if he tackles student debt in a future thriller \u2014 and he gave vent, just a bit, to his political views. The short version: He doesn\u2019t think much of Donald Trump. The slightly longer, more diplomatic version: \u201cI still pull for the underdog. I still like the little guy, especially when the little guy is getting screwed by the big guy: the government, a corporation, an issue, whatever. .\u2008.\u2008. But you\u2019ve got to be careful with your audience, because they don\u2019t always share my politics.
