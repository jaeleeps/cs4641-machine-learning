The author Skye McAlpine shares pantry tips and guides you through dishes that exploit the sea, the market and the nearby fields. Simple pastas dressed with vegetables, fennel au gratin, typically soupy risottos, a zucchini and mint frittata, and peaches in amaretto syrup are some standouts, and her fig-and-mascarpone cake, and pine nut-and-custard tart are first-rate. The author has lived in Venice almost all her life and throughout the book she gives you an idea of what that\u2019s all about: Buy only what you can carry because you do not have a car, something New Yorkers also appreciate.",

Hall, who died on June 23, left behind a rich collection of poetry that earned him a National Medal of the Arts and a term as poet laureate of the United States. In his last memoir, he writes of life as he approached 90, with all its joys (like solitude or the ability to speak one\u2019s mind fully) and its losses (like the death of his wife, the poet Jane Kenyon). THE BATTLE FOR PARADISE By Naomi Klein. (Haymarket, paper, $9.95.) Hurricane Maria left more than destruction in its wake. There is now a brewing political conflict over how to rebuild Puerto Rico, the subject of Klein\u2019s investigation in this slim book. On one side are what she calls the \u201cdisaster capitalists\u201d looking for a profit, and on the other, local communities. THE WILLIAM H. GASS READER By William H. Gass. (Knopf, $40.) A doorstop that celebrates the life of the experimental writer, this collection brings together over 50 examples of Gass\u2019s work \u2014 essays, criticism, short stories and novels. All heady and mysterious. TRANS LIKE ME By CN Lester. (Seal Press, paper, $16.99.) A British transgender rights activist and singer-songwriter, Lester uses these witty essays to help undermine some persistent myths. For example, Lester finds a long history of the use of \u201cthey\u201d to describe a person who doesn\u2019t fit into one gender or another, with examples dating to Shakespeare and Jane Austen. LACKS SELF-CONTROL By Roy Sekoff. (Big A, $25.) Sekoff was the founding editor of The Huffington Post and here writes of a life of mischief and high jinks, from a teenage visit to a Times Square porn store to his attempt to nab a tissue containing Oprah\u2019s tears.",

			"lead_paragraph": "Tom Wolfe, who died on May 14, had a lesser-known but not-so-secret passion: He loved to draw caricatures and cartoons with the same incisive, sarcastic wit that came through in his written social commentary. His pictures were inspired by the turn-of-the-century German Jugendstil (\u201cyouth style,\u201d or Art Nouveau), graphic artist provocateurs who regularly outraged both bourgeois and aristocratic Junker classes by poking holes in their masks and debunking their pretensions in the notorious weekly satirical journal Simplicissimus (also known as Der Simpl in the 1940s). He also owed a debt to his favorite visual trickster, Ronald Searle, whom Wolfe praised as a \u201cgiant of the graphic netherworld\u201d on the front page of a 1981 Times Book Review. Wolfe surprisingly identified as much as a cartoonist as he did a writer, and many of his drawings were captioned. In 1979, the same year that \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d was published, he wrote the introduction to an exhibition catalog I edited on Simplicissimus. \u201cCaricaturists, as any caricaturist can tell you,\u201d he wrote, \u201clive, work and die in a shantytown scarcely visible from that monumental Bras\u00edlia known as the world of art.\u201d He was referring to his own inclination for the comic art form, which he started practicing in 1956 at The Springfield Union (the predecessor of The Republican) in Massachusetts. He continued: \u201cThe few miserable souls in the fine art classes who are interested in caricature pass around pictures by the artists they admire, quietly, by hand, as if in some Novosibirsk samizdat network.\u201d He likened his first introduction to the work of the master graphistes from Der Simpl, at the Union in 1959, to having discovered another planet \u201cwhere, as in science fiction novels, the creatures were more enlightened than those on earth.\u201d In 1980, Wolfe emerged from his self-imposed netherworld with \u201cIn Our Time,\u201d his book of mocking sketches and stinging essays about the 1970s\u2019 absurd fashions, trendy morals and silly conceits. The drawings from that book reprinted here pay overt homage to the style of the period, but even more to the audacity of its artists to subversively \u2014 often savagely \u2014 lampoon their targets while still leaving them laughing and wanting more.",

In early October, the dining facilities at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a neo-Classical landmark built in 1928, will be the first component of the Frank Gehry-led redesign of the museum\u2019s interior to open to the public. Mr. Gehry was selected for the renovation in 2006, but the wheels for the master plan didn\u2019t start turning until 2010. (The whole project will be completed by 2020.) A 76-seat restaurant called Stir, to be run by Starr Catering, which came up with the restaurant\u2019s name, will be warmly wood-paneled in Douglas fir, with a ceiling that undulates, Gehry-style. Central to the ceiling is a gridlike sculpture of curved crisscrossed slats and beams.  Mr. Gehry\u2019s contribution to the restaurant includes the tables and chairs, but not the tableware. The chef Mark Tropea, a former chef for residents of 15 Central Park West, an apartment tower in New York, will preside over the open kitchen. He plans to offer seasonal fare with strong local connections, like Kennett Square mushrooms, Barnegat scallops and a burger topped with Lancaster Cheddar. A new, enlarged cafeteria, also run by Starr Catering, is part of the plan. The dining options do not have an outside entrance, so museum admission is required for entry. \u201cWe envision it as part of a total museum experience,\u201d Gail Harrity, the museum\u2019s chief operating officer, wrote in an email.

The meticulous organization scheme together with the curved lines connecting lexical groupings reveal both the \u201csystematic phonetic\u201d and the \u201chistorical\u201d relationships between these individual tongues, while the numerous self-correction marks reflect a literary mind almost obsessed with perfecting each and every one of them, \u201cin both comprehensive tabulation and in minute detail.\u201d",

Later, to order, it\u2019s finished on the grill and served sliced with more smoked salt. The meat has a subtle, alluring woodsy char in its aroma and flavor.

Up you go to the 60th floor, the entirety of which is given over to the restaurant and the Bay Room, a spacious private event space (Mr. Meyer\u2019s first) that abuts it. It\u2019s worth going at least for a drink at the commanding 40-foot black walnut bar, which, like the restaurant, has sweeping views of the city and New Jersey. (There\u2019s no back bar lined with bottles, lest they interfere. And the d\u00e9cor is suitably understated, with dark wood furnishings and bronze accents that would suit a tavern.) If you tire of the panorama, there\u2019s a gleaming open kitchen, with Jason Pfeifer, the executive chef, and his team at work. Though Mr. Pfeifer was last seen in the kitchen Maialino, here he looks more to France than to Italy. The well-tailored informality and emphasis on seasonality have much in common with Mr. Meyer\u2019s flagship Union Square Cafe. \u201cAt Manhatta, there\u2019s less emphasis on California and the Mediterranean,\u201d Mr. Pfeifer said. The evening menu offers peekytoe crab salad with leeks and artichokes, a French onion burger, duck tortellini in consomm\u00e9 and classic veal blanquette. Lunch is coming soon. Chocolate mousse, a vanilla souffl\u00e9 and blackberries with walnut gelato and sabayon cater to the sweet tooth. ",

The 450-degree smoke point is higher than butter\u2019s.

Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, the owners, who founded the company in Prospect Heights seven years ago, were dealing with raw space. \u201cWe had to build the infrastructure from scratch,\u201d Mr. Smith said. They also had to switch architects midstream. The new 15,000-square-foot facility, with a scoop shop and counters in front and behind it, a playroom and an interactive museum of ice cream, is built into Beard Street Warehouses. Part of a series of brick storerooms from the mid-19th century, the warehouses were once used to hold goods like cotton and coffee. The space has allowed Ample Hills to improve production with the capacity to churn out 500,000 gallons a year (right now they\u2019re at 50,000). In place of batch freezers, there is now a continuous system. Mix-ins like cookie pieces made in the bakery are added automatically and pints are filled by machine, not by hand. Mr. Smith said that, if anything, this industrialization should enhance the ice cream\u2019s texture. And though the company is now able to deliver pints to many more retail shops, Mr. Smith said they would keep opening scoop shops, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to be pints in grocery stores.\u201d Los Angeles will have an Ample Hills in the fall, followed by another one on Prospect Park West, to bring the total to 13.",
