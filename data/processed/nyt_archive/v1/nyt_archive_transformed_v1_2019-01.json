The dramatic volcano would have been an obvious choice of subject for Gall, whose work has focused on nature \u2014 from formal gardens to underground caves \u2014 for more than three decades. But there, in the ancient city of Syracuse, a surprising fascination emerged: \u201cAs I walked through all the narrow streets,\u201d she says, \u201cmy gaze was drawn upward to a swirl of moving color, which turned out to be laundry hung out to dry from balconies.\u201d Over the next two years, Gall traveled to seaside cities in Italy, Cuba and Croatia, capturing the movement and forms of hanging laundry and, later, kites. Inspired by the nonrepresentational paintings of Kandinsky and Mir\u00f3, she pared away all but the essential details, developing abstract compositions against clear blue skies. The resulting series \u2014 now on view at Julie Saul Gallery in New York City \u2014 is transformative: In image after image, whirling, wind-tossed dish towels, dresses and denim conjure the shapes and colors of blooming poppies and flocks of birds.

He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche.

The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s now less fiesta and more tavern,\u201d Mr. Stupak said. The menu will feature tacos, as well as fried-chicken sandwiches, broiled oysters with hoja santa and bacon, Chihuahua cheese sticks, pork fried rice and crunchy corn masa ice cream bars.

He edited the \u201cEncyclop\u00e9die,\u201d for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts. Below, Curran talks about grave robbers, Diderot\u2019s political prescience, how he was like Benjamin Franklin and more.",

On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d Farhadi\u2019s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days \u2014 apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on.\u201d For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump\u2019s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of \u201creciprocal humiliation\u201d that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that \u201creciprocal\u201d showed extraordinary equanimity \u2014 not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",

Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on \u201ctrue creative fulfillment.\u201d What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them. A muckraking Twitter thread materialized, scorning Calloway as a \u201cscammer\u201d; she promptly canceled and then uncanceled the tour, all while zapping out flurries of alternately self-flagellating and self-justifying posts on Instagram Stories.",
