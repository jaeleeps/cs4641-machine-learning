What was Salvation Taco is now under the management of Alex Stupak of Empell\\u00f3n, Taqueria and Al Pastor. (Mr. Stupak took over Salvation Taco last year after April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, who ran the restaurant, left amid a sexual harassment scandal over Mr. Friedman\\u2019s treatment of employees.) Though Mr. Stupak has a casual Al Pastor taqueria in the East Village, he says this latest restaurant is not merely a spinoff. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an evolution,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s bar food inspired by Mexico and also by fun lowbrow American food like corn dogs. There\\u2019s also waiter service here.\\u201d Mr. Stupak said that he had resisted offers to turn Al Pastor into a fast-casual place in airports and food halls, and that he felt this project suited him better. The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. \\u201cIt\\u2019s now less fiesta and more tavern,\\u201d Mr. Stupak said. The menu will feature tacos, as well as fried-chicken sandwiches, broiled oysters with hoja santa and bacon, Chihuahua cheese sticks, pork fried rice and crunchy corn masa ice cream bars. Breakfast will be served.

The d\\u00e9cor is vintage New York, drawing largely from the 1920s to the \\u201940s, with old photographs, subtle references to The New York Times (which once occupied the building) and books from that era that are used to present the dinner check.
