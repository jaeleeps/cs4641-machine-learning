Far-right strategists hope that the election will resemble Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, while pro-European progressives expect the elections to resemble the second round of the presidential vote in France in 2017, when Emmanuel Macron defeated Marine Le Pen.

			"lead_paragraph": "Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s first seafood restaurant anchors two floors, with terraces and sweeping views, at Pier 17 in the seaport district. There\u2019s lots of gray, with banquettes upholstered in sea-foam green by Yabu Pushelberg. The various dining areas have hand-painted murals of sea life and hanging lights that resemble buoys. On the ground floor, there are booths and tables, a semi-open kitchen and a bright prep counter. Upstairs is a marble oyster bar and more booths and tables. The menu is lengthy and divided into raw bar items, crudos, appetizers, seafood main dishes and vegetables, with a few pastas and meat dishes, like a burger and beef carpaccio. \u201cI wanted to keep it simple and use as much local seafood as I could,\u201d Mr. Vongerichten said. Locally harvested oysters, clams, fluke, mackerel, monkfish, sea scallops, lobsters and black sea bass share the menu with more far-flung catches, like Santa Barbara sea urchin, sardines, Dover sole, Icelandic cod and geoduck. Inventive sauces and garnishes, like rhubarb for sea scallops, are used throughout. The name refers to the wholesale fish market, now relocated to Hunts Point in the Bronx, where Mr. Vongerichten shopped as a young chef in the 1980s. (Opens the week of May 13) ",

Try this at home: Whisk together three-quarters cup of all-purpose flour, a quarter cup of rice flour, a teaspoon-and-a-half of baking powder and a half-teaspoon, or more, of salt. Mix in two-thirds cup water, then fold in 10 ounces of fresh or frozen corn kernels (almost two cups), two scallions, minced, and a finely chopped Fresno or jalape\u00f1o chile. In a saut\u00e9 pan or cast-iron skillet, heat an inch of vegetable oil, such as grapeseed, to 375 degrees. For 16 medium-size fritters, drop batter by heaping tablespoons into hot oil, flatten slightly and fry, turning once, until well browned. Drain on paper towels before serving. For eight large ones, as they are served in the restaurant, use about a half-cup of batter for each and flatten them. Scallions, cilantro and fried shallots are typical toppings.",

Today it is estimated that the original plot \u2014 \u201cthe mother block\u201d of trees on his estate, Morgenster \u2014 has provided millions of olive trees to growers in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, essentially kick-starting olive oil production throughout Southern Africa.

Mr. Bertrand died last year at 91, but his daughters, Federica and Alessandra Bertrand, continue to run the estate, which has 30,000 trees and also produces wines. And the olive oils are perennial prizewinners. The 2018 bottling was ranked among the best in the world by Flos Olei, an olive oil guidebook. The 2018 oil is the estate\u2019s flagship blend of 14 varietals, each picked and pressed separately before being combined.

Many years later, when he worked as an animal-feed trader in Hamburg, he didn\u2019t tell friends that he was Jewish and held his tongue when he heard them make anti-Semitic comments.

One holier option is this medieval mystery mini-series, the adaptation of Umberto Eco\u2019s best-known novel, \u201cThe Name of the Rose,\u201d by the  Italian director Giacomo Battiato. The book, which came out in 1980,  sold millions of copies, and was the basis for a 1986 film adaptation with Sean Connery. The role Connery played, a Franciscan friar named William of Baskerville, is here played by John Turturro. The plot involves  mysterious deaths at a remote abbey. When the Connery movie came out, Vincent Canby said in his review for The New York Times that it had cut out the novel\u2019s scholarly asides, which \u201ccover everything from the political maneuvering within the Avignon papacy, the fight for the Holy Roman Empire and the church\u2019s merciless suppression of heresies (Waldensian, Albigensian and Catharist, among others) to the invention of eyeglasses and gunpowder.\u201d The mini-series format might make room for more of Eco\u2019s embellishments onscreen.",

The tradition, which means \u201csmelling the breeze\u201d in Arabic, is believed to be as old as the pharaohs, and celebrates the arrival of spring.

Directed by Lee and counting the playwright Eisa Davis among its writers, the first season introduced a new Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise) and a feminist lens. \u201cMore expansive than interior, more defiant than dreamy, it\u2019s a vibrant if uneven work in heated conversation with itself,\u201d James Poniewozik wrote in his review of the first season for The New York Times. The second season, which debuts Friday, also makes time for episodes in Puerto Rico and on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, in addition to its native Brooklyn. Anthony Ramos (\u201cHamilton\u201d) returns as Mars Blackmon, the lover of Nola\u2019s who was played by Lee in 1986. \u201cAt the end of Season 1, we knew who everybody was,\u201d Lee said recently in an interview with the website Blackfilm. \u201cSeason 2 is \u2018now what?\u2019\u201d",

Forty years (and nine sequels and remakes) later, John Carpenter\u2019s classic slasher film got yet another update, one that reprised Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019s role as the baby sitter who survived a killing spree on Halloween night. Ignoring the narratives of the franchise\u2019s other films, this reboot by David Gordon Green has our masked villain, Michael Myers (played by James Jude Courtney and the originating actor, Nick Castle), escape from a prison transfer and head straight back to Haddonfield. He\u2019s out for Laurie, of course, who has become a paranoid, rabid grandmother with a fortress for a house. Fans of the original know what to expect, and overall, they should be pleased with the gruesome result. \u201cGreen wants us to believe in his Bogeyman, and Curtis is his ace card,\u201d Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her New York Times review. \u201cLeaving no room for winks or giggles, she makes Laurie\u2019s long-festering terror the glue that holds the movie together.\u201d ",
