The story appeared, astonishingly, in The New England Journal of Medicine in the summer of 2007. Adopted as a kitten by the medical staff, Oscar reigned over one floor of the Steere House nursing home in Rhode Island. When the cat would sniff the air, crane his neck and curl up next to a man or woman, it was a sure sign of impending demise. The doctors would call the families to come in for their last visit. Over the course of several years, the cat had curled up next to 50 patients. Every one of them died shortly thereafter.",

The city almost saw the end of his career as well: at a 1958 book signing in Harlem, a woman named Izola Ware Curry stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, convinced that Dr. King and others in the movement were plotting against her (she was committed to a hospital for the criminally insane). Dr. King remembered the incident in his \u201cI Have Been to the Mountaintop\u201d speech a day before his death, noting that if he had sneezed while the blade was in him, he would not have survived to see the gains of the movement he led. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that I didn\u2019t sneeze,\u201d he said.",

No faces are immediately evident, just figures in camel-colored coats turned away from us, a puff of smoke with two people suspended in it. No, four people, if you count those shadows, six if you count the backs on which the shadows fall. In fact there are seven people, if we count the additional shadow in the foreground, the photographer\u2019s \u2014 and further figures emerge as the eye adjusts to the deep background.

The takeover began as a protest in the town of Burns after two ranchers were sentenced to prison for arsons on federal land. The ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, caught the attention of the Nevada rancher Ammon Bundy, who thought the punishment unfair. Bundy and a crowd of nearly 300 marchers paraded through Burns, and a splinter group eventually took over the Malheur headquarters. For 41 days, they refused to leave, protesting federal ownership of public lands, which they considered unlawful and abusive.

This graphic novel has a simple, gritty style. It tells the story of Padre Chinchachoma, a Catholic priest known on the streets of Mexico City as a protector of homeless children who raised the ire of the local police and was suspected of sexual abuse. CULTURE AS WEAPON By Nato Thompson. (Melville House, $24.99.) Thompson is an art curator and activist who has a problem with the way that corporations have co-opted the realm of culture to ensure profits, shape public opinion and control dissent. IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I AM AMERICA Edited by Jonathan Santlofer. (Touchstone, $30.) Timed to the first anniversary of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, this collection packs in an impressive array of fiction writers and illustrators. The likes of Joyce Carol Oates, Neil Gaiman and Art Spiegelman assert their own visions for a democratic society. NIKOLAI GOGOL By Vladimir Nabokov. (New Directions, $16.95.) In Nabokov\u2019s classic biography of the Russian novelist, newly reissued, he begins with Gogol\u2019s death and works back to his birth.

With a pair of powerfully inefficient Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines, the plane was flown by discount airlines after its completion in 1991 (the first in Denmark, the second in Mexico) before it was sold in 1995 to Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder. Allen is said to have selected this particular plane from his personal fleet to ferry about his N.F.L. team, the Seattle Seahawks. In 2011, Donald J. Trump reportedly paid $100 million for the plane and in short order erased whatever traces of Seahawk might have remained: The plane\u2019s face-lift included the installation of a silken master bedroom, as well as 24-karat-gold plating on the bathroom fixtures and seatbelts.",

The hotel design is elaborate, by Jacques Garcia, the designer of the NoMad in New York, where Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara also run the restaurant and bars. Mr. Guidara said they did not want the menus to replicate those in New York, so for Los Angeles the food is somewhat lighter \u2014 like a blue prawn club sandwich with avocado, and various preparations of broccoli, served with black rice and egg.

Simon & the Whale, with 76 seats and some outdoor tables to come, has an Arts and Crafts look from the designers, Roman & Williams, with Japanese Iroko wood, iridescent teal tiles, green tufted upholstery and brass piping.
