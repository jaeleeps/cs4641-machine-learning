Referred to by the British, straightforwardly, as table football, and by the French, adorably, as le baby-foot (the term \u201cfoosball\u201d comes from the German word for soccer), it was, by some accounts, created in the 1930s by a French automobile engineer, Lucien Rosengart. The Spanish anarchist and publisher Alejandro Finisterre also claimed to have invented futbol\u00edn while recovering from injuries sustained in the Spanish Civil War, and the Englishman Harold Searles Thornton filed a patent for a similar setup in 1923. The French fashion and leather goods company Louis Vuitton, however, is less concerned with establishing the republic\u2019s title to le baby-foot than in designing the most aesthetically pleasing version imaginable. Offered in seven different finishes, including leathers such as the brand\u2019s textured Epi in colors like cyan and pistachio, as well as the iconic logoed canvas pictured here, the table\u2019s hand-painted, custom-matched aluminum-cast players are modeled on the hotel porter character from Vuitton\u2019s 1921 advertising campaign. Foosball\u2019s origins may not be certain, but this is: You won\u2019t find this particular amusement in the corner of some subterranean rec room.

After stumbling upon a very tiny flower vase made of sterling silver at a flea market, which she wanted to wear as a necklace, she began sketching ideas with a silversmith in Spain. Her early creations were instinctive and macabre, inspired by animal skulls, scorpions and even X-rays of her own skeleton. In 1974, she joined Tiffany & Co. as a designer, where her sinuous and sculptural pieces \u2014 such as the Bean, Diamonds by the Yard and the Open Heart \u2014 quickly became signatures of the 1837-founded American jewelry house. That same year, Peretti traveled throughout Jaipur, India, and the city\u2019s glittering light inspired her to begin working with mesh. Halston debuted a gold mesh bra and scarf designed by Peretti for Tiffany in his fall 1975 runway collection, which she produced on old machinery that had been used to make handbags in fine metal netting and chain mail in the early 20th century. The mesh designs were a hit: \u201cTiffany was swamped with calls from people dying to get a gold bra,\u201d Peretti recalled.",

Time speeds up, and we see her eldest son, Remington, as a toddler, grinning hugely before diving into a pool. Then time retreats as Fox Rich reminisces about how Rob\u2019s smile snared her heart.

It had to vacate its garagelike premises last year. Then, just a few weeks after opening in a new space nearby, Barbuto was derailed by the pandemic. Mr. Waxman\u2019s new cookbook about the restaurant gives its history, notably explaining why so much of his food relates to Italy. Even his famous roast chicken is slathered with salsa verde. The recipes in this book, including the chicken, are simple affairs, often amounting to a centerpiece protein precisely cooked, then dressed with a salad or vegetable and sauce. His baked hake with leeks is a fine example. Cauliflower soup and cacio e pepe are two recipes worth whipping up on short notice. Pizza-making and pastas are covered in depth.",

Sick and tired of working in kitchens, unseen and uncelebrated, stalling out while the people around him came up. In 1940, working in obscurity as a caterer, he lifted a recipe from his colleagues Irma Rhode and her brother Bill Rhode \u2014 known as New York\u2019s king of hors d\u2019oeuvres \u2014 and published it as his own. It was a cute cocktail sandwich of soft, buttery bread and finely sliced onion called brioche en surprise, a hit at the events he and the Rhodes had worked together. But as Beard became more famous, the sandwich got a new, unofficial name: James Beard\u2019s onion sandwich. Beard earned (along with a reputation for chronic, unapologetic plagiarism) his own nickname, the Dean of American Cookery. It was a good nickname, a strong nickname, though in suggesting a kind of elite prep school tucked away from the real world, it also gave away some truths about the small circle of people defining American food: They were insular, petty and competitive. And if Beard was their dean \u2014 a champion of American regional ingredients and the cooks who supported them \u2014 he was also a fragile and sometimes predatory influencer, an outsider aching for companionship and financial success.",

But the question of what, precisely, constitutes protest art is a thorny one \u2014 and we kept tripping over it. Is it a slogan? A poster? Does it matter if it was in a museum, in a newspaper or out on the street? Does impact matter? Did it change what you think or believe? Must it endure? What does that mean?

Why does the project propose this? In part because, as its essays show, the system of slavery and oppression that began on this date has led to so many of the problems that define our past and our present; in part because, as Hannah-Jones argues, the struggle against this system of oppression has been a pivotal freedom movement unfolding across many generations to advance progress for American society as a whole; and in part to advance the case that, as the heroes of both of these stories, Black Americans, whose presence in the English colonies that would become the United States began on this date, should occupy a central role in American history.",

According to \u201cThe Gardener\u2019s Companion to Medicinal Plants,\u201d a 2016 guide to home remedies, the study of herbal medicine can be traced back 5,000 years, to the Sumerians of southern Mesopotamia, who listed the names of hundreds of plants \u2014 including fennel, mint, thyme, sage, myrtle and marjoram \u2014 on clay tablets that were later rediscovered in what is now Iraq. Modern scholars believe that the Sumerians used what they grew in medicinal preparations such as tea infusions that were intended to treat ailments from toothache to inflammation. And in England, says Timothy d\u2019Offay, a tea importer and the founder of Postcard Teas in London, tea gardens have their origins in the work of 17th-century apothecaries such as Nicholas Culpeper, a botanist and physician whose encyclopedia of herbs, \u201cThe English Physician,\u201d has remained in print since it was first published in 1653. \u201cThe apothecaries\u2019 focus was on the use of herbs in healing,\u201d explains d\u2019Offay. \u201cIt was really the beginnings of modern medicine.

The terroir of the sugar cane, the way the rum is made and distilled, aging conditions and proof all affect the result, often distinctive enough to make the drink characteristic of its origins. Plantation Isle of Fiji Double Barrel Rum \u2014 an ultrasmooth amber sipper, with a touch of spice to enhance a flavor that conveys molasses, tropical fruit and fudge \u2014 boasts an unusual trajectory. It\u2019s distilled from Fijian sugar cane in both alembic and column stills and aged for no less than two years in bourbon casks on Fiji. Then it travels to Ars in southwest France, where it\u2019s aged another year in the Cognac casks of Maison Ferrand, which owns the brand.",
