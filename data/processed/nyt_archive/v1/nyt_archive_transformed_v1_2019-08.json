The regime claimed that the memorial, which houses the remains of some 34,000 Civil War dead, was intended to honor all who fell in the conflict, but this was gaslighting on a world-historical scale: Tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of them former Republican soldiers, labored for almost 20 years, between 1940 and 1959, to build what would eventually become their tormentor\u2019s final resting place.",

Colman, who won an Academy Award for her performance, portrays Queen Anne, the last monarch of the House of Stuart, as she faces ill health and waning political credibility. But the film\u2019s primary focus is the love triangle between Anne; Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), the Duchess of Marlborough and a close adviser to the queen; and Sarah\u2019s rival, Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), a chambermaid turned close confidant. A.O. Scott, who chose the film as a Critic\u2019s Pick, wrote in his New York Times review: \u201cWeisz and Stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble, but Colman\u2019s performance is nothing short of sublime. She commits absolutely to Anne\u2019s ridiculousness, and also to the contradictory facets of her humanity.\u201d",

Some ice cream shops, including Four Winters, a new ice cream shop in Queens, use the same technique. A narrow storefront, this English import has an open kitchen, ingredients on view and seating. The ice cream is churned for each order: The results are ultrasmooth since the quick freeze keeps the ice crystals from forming. Basic flavors are chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, sweet cream and vegan chocolate, with housemade mix-in options. Specialty varieties include Key lime pie, cereal crunch, vegan chocolate peanut butter and spectacular s\u2019mores. The most popular is knafeh, with pistachios and bits of kadayif, reflecting the Middle Eastern origins of the founders, Omar Alkhawaja, Zeid Zabian and Zaynab Abdullah.

It stands alone with elegant velvet upholstery, marble tables and vintage touches. \u201cI wanted to cater to the Gramercy neighborhood and have a beautiful setting, a place where you\u2019d want to enjoy a bottle of wine,\u201d he said. \u201cMost restaurants with food from Singapore and Malaysia don\u2019t have that.\u201d Mr. Mehta is also an owner of Laut, a Malaysian restaurant nearby. Among the dishes at the new restaurant are curry puffs with potato, chicken and beef satays, crispy rice salad with vegetables, sweet and spicy chile crab, and Hainanese chicken with rice, chiles, garlic, shallots and soy sauce. Both the crab and the chicken are signature Singaporean dishes. As for that bottle of wine alongside, it may take a while: The restaurant\u2019s alcohol license is not expected until the end of September. (Opens Friday) ",

			"lead_paragraph": "SCHIAPARELLI. THE NAME alone conjures images of absurd beauty: lobsters as dresses, a shoe as a hat, a particularly blinding shade of pink \u2014 and, of course, the fearless Italian modernist herself, Elsa Schiaparelli, who fled her conservative Italian family and con man of a husband to become one of fashion\u2019s great iconoclasts. And so it\u2019s only fitting that, for his debut as artistic director at the house, founded in 1927, Daniel Roseberry began with an origin story of his own. On the first day of the Paris couture shows this past July, the handsome 33-year-old sat down at a drafting table positioned in the middle of the runway inside the Pavillon Cambon, on a set meant to resemble the unheated Chinatown studio in New York where he created his first set of drawings for the brand last December. As the designer picked up his pencil, the lights went up and the models appeared, his sketches coming to life. There were no lip brooches or skeleton dresses; none of the totems Elsa made famous. Instead, Roseberry put forth his own proposal for fearlessness and surrealism, a celebration of both material craftsmanship and the female form. There were wild takes on suiting \u2014 a long navy captain\u2019s coat trimmed at the sleeves and bias in flat gold leather bands resembling ruffled military ribbons worn over a delicate black-and-white lace bodysuit; a sharp barathea tuxedo jacket with 117 dangling crystal tassels, each affixed to the garment with a single scarlet-lacquered acrylic fingernail \u2014 and fantastical evening looks, some with bedazzled breast cups in ruby, diamond and sapphire hues that appeared to float on their own above heavy raw silk tulip skirts in chalky blue, sunflower yellow or acid green. For the finale, two gowns \u2014 one sheet white, the other a wild rose pink \u2014 pushed the idea of illusion further still, with supple silk taffeta that billowed out and above the models as if a gust of Marilyn Monroe-style wind had blown these confections toward the heavens and frozen them in that moment. Here, as in the original house of Schiaparelli, there was no place for self-doubt.",

On a trip to Tangier, he came across \u201cM\u00e8re et Fils,\u201d a 2014 book of photographs by the now 61-year-old French artist Denis Dailleux, who lived in Egypt for many years. The images, at once erotic and tender, were of shirtless male Egyptian bodybuilders photographed with their mothers. Barth\u00e9lemy, now 30, was so struck by them that he decided to go to Cairo himself, where he fell in love with the chaos of the city. He later moved there, into a spacious but faded \u201960s-era flat. One day, he visited a tiny stall south of Bab Zuwayla in Suq al-Khayamiya (\u201cTentmakers\u2019 Market\u201d), where an artisan named Tarek Abdelhay Hafez Abouelenin was hand-making a khayamiya \u2014 a vibrant quiltlike work featuring ornate appliqu\u00e9 patterns sewn onto a plain cotton canvas backing, a textile that has been used to cover the insides of tents at weddings, celebrations and funerals for over a millennium. Not surprisingly, the meticulous, time-consuming work is a dying art (most contemporary khayamiya are digitally printed), which made Abouelenin\u2019s work all the more extraordinary. The two men agreed to collaborate on a different sort of khayamiya, one that would stray from traditional arabesque and calligraphic motifs \u2014 and would defy the Islamic taboo against both realistic representation and homoeroticism.",

The artist\u2019s coming exhibition at Pace Gallery in Palo Alto, Calif., which will open on August 21, includes work from four decades of her career, ranging from the curving tubular \u201csparkle paper\u201d sculptures she has produced since 2013 \u2014 brightly colored totems created from handmade paper draped around amorphous chicken-wire forms \u2014 to \u201cEat Meat,\u201d a fleshy human-size blob of poured-polyurethane foam that Benglis first fashioned in 1969 and recast in aluminum in 2012. Each piece in the show is laced with memory. Recently, she recalled how her childhood trips from her hometown, Lake Charles, La., to the rocky Greek island of Kastellorizo, where her paternal grandparents once lived, informed her fascination with rugged textures, while she attributed her keen understanding of color, seen in works such as the hot-pink crystalline cast-polyurethane wall sculpture \u201cSwinburne Figure I\u201d (2009) and the shimmering multicolor paper-and-wire sculpture \u201cFlag Twister\u201d (2017), to watching birds as a girl with her grandfather in Mississippi.",

On arrival, you step into an attractive university city of riverside promenades, grand stone squares and historical townhouses with one of France\u2019s largest produce markets (which feeds a copious restaurant scene), along with a dense concentration of bars. A bit north, the walled town of St.-Malo enchants with its storybook streets and ramparts (destroyed in World War II and rebuilt), sea-swept rocky shoreline and proximity to France\u2019s most mystical spot of all: the island of Mont-St.-Michel.",

It was her first tournament since withdrawing from the French Open with a shoulder injury. Andreescu won four consecutive three-set matches on her way to the title in Toronto, where she won when Serena Williams retired during the final because of back spasms. In March, Andreescu surprised the tennis world by winning at Indian Wells, Calif., defeating Angelique Kerber to claim her first tour title. Andreescu, No. 15 in the world, has credited her speedy rise in the rankings to the meditation and visualization techniques her mother taught her when she was 12. With her unflappable demeanor, Andreescu is rock solid from the baseline, with superb movement and disciplined shot selection. She uses the drop shot shrewdly, often wrong-footing opponents by going behind them. ",

I thought of \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cSigns\u201d and for the rest of the puzzle my antennae were tuned to cinematic undertones, which are rife today. But there are plenty of other quirks and tropes and \u201cpatternish\u201d riffs to unearth, which have become a trait of Mr. Ezersky\u2019s fresh and impressive themeless puzzles. Oh, and there\u2019s a bonus column, if you\u2019re the noticing type: This grid is an unusual 16 x 15, which is supposedly always for a specific reason, which our constructor graciously explains below.",

Last year, the film that was shot over the two-night concert there under the direction of Sydney Pollack finally made it to theaters, giving the public the opportunity to see \u2014 and not just hear \u2014 what happened in that church. The movie also gives plenty of attention to the proceedings\u2019s very qualified host, the Rev. James Cleveland.\u201d \u201cThis is obviously one of the great music films, less epic in scope than, say, \u2018The Last Waltz\u2019 but as glorious in communal feeling and South Los Angeles zeal as \u2018Wattstax\u2019 (the natural partner for a double feature) and as musically imaginative as \u2018Stop Making Sense,\u2019\u201d Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The New York Times. \u201cWhat distinguishes \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 what lifts it to the penthouse, is a mix of energy and moment.\u201d",

Though ubiquitous in churches since the High Middle Ages, when stained-glass windows taught the congregation Bible stories through imagery, it waned with the rise of unadorned Protestantism in the late 17th century.

Just make a few calls, put out some food and something to drink, light a couple of candles and allow everyone to gather as if you won\u2019t see them for a year. Embrace the symbolism. Say goodbye.",
